## üîç HOW TO USE THE 100% YES TEST

### STEP 1: GET GROUNDED
- Take 3 deep breaths
- Feel your feet on the ground
- Center yourself in your body
- Clear your mind of "shoulds"

### STEP 2: ASK THE QUESTION
Ask yourself clearly:
**"Is this a 100% YES for me right now?"**

### STEP 3: FEEL, DON'T THINK
- Drop into your BODY, not your mind
- Notice your first physical response
- Don't analyze or justify
- Trust the immediate sensation

### STEP 4: WAIT FOR THE RESPONSE
- Give yourself 3-5 seconds
- Feel what arises
- Notice: Expansion or contraction?
- Notice: Opening or closing?

### STEP 5: HONOR THE ANSWER
- 100% YES = Proceed with confidence
- Anything else = It's a NO (or not yet)
- Don't override your body's wisdom

---

## üí° EXAMPLES OF A 100% YES

**"Ice cream is a 100% YES for me."** - This is the feeling you're looking for.

Think of something you LOVE with no hesitation:
- Your favorite food
- A beloved person
- An activity you adore
- A place that feels like home

**THAT feeling = 100% YES**

Now apply that same test to your decisions.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON TRAPS & HOW TO AVOID THEM

### TRAP #1: "But I SHOULD say yes..."
**Solution:** "Should" is never a 100% YES. If obligation is involved, it's not a true yes.

### TRAP #2: "What will people think if I say no?"
**Solution:** Other people's opinions are NOT your compass. Your body is.

### TRAP #3: "Maybe it will become a YES later..."
**Solution:** Test it NOW. If it's not a yes now, say no. You can always reassess later.

### TRAP #4: "I can't afford to say no..."
**Solution:** You can't afford to say YES to what's not aligned. The cost is your energy, peace, and alignment.

### TRAP #5: "I'm not sure what I'm feeling..."
**Solution:** That uncertainty = NOT a 100% yes. Practice with small decisions to develop your sensitivity.

### TRAP #6: "My mind says yes but my body says no..."
**Solution:** ALWAYS trust the body over the mind. The mind lies; the body knows.

## üéì PRACTICING THE 100% YES TEST

### Start Small:
Practice with low-stakes decisions:
- What to eat for dinner?
- Which route to take?
- What to wear today?
- Which friend to call?

### Build Your Sensitivity:
- Notice the subtle differences between YES and NO
- Pay attention to your body's language
- Track your accuracy (did you honor the YES? What happened?)
- Refine your ability to discern

### Progress to Bigger Decisions:
Once you trust your 100% YES on small things:
- Career choices
- Relationship decisions
- Living situations
- Major purchases
- Life direction

---

## üö´ YOU DON'T NEED TO JUSTIFY A "NO"

### CRITICAL TRUTH:

**YOU DON'T NEED TO EXCUSE WHY SOMETHING DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.**

**Examples:**
- "Having sex with someone doesn't feel right" ‚Üí Accept it. Move on. No explanation needed.
- "Taking that job doesn't feel right" ‚Üí Honor it. No justification required.
- "Going to that event doesn't feel right" ‚Üí Say no. Period.

### Your "NO" is complete on its own.

You don't owe anyone:
- ‚ùå An explanation
- ‚ùå A logical reason
- ‚ùå A defense
- ‚ùå An apology

**Your body's wisdom is enough.**

---

## üåü WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FOLLOW 100% YES

When you consistently honor your 100% YES:

‚ú® **You become pure medicine** for yourself and others
‚ú® **You evolve exponentially**
‚ú® **You become your own teacher and guide**
‚ú® **You need almost nothing from anyone else**
‚ú® **Life flows with less resistance**
‚ú® **Synchronicities increase**
‚ú® **Energy increases**
‚ú® **Clarity becomes your default**
‚ú® **You trust yourself completely**

---

## üîÑ WHAT TO DO WITH "NOT A 100% YES"

If something is NOT a 100% YES, you have two options:

### OPTION 1: Say NO
Simply decline. Honor your body's wisdom. Move on.

### OPTION 2: Dig Into the Block
Ask yourself:
- **"What's preventing this from being a 100% YES?"**
- **"What fear/belief is in the way?"**
- **"What needs to be healed for this to feel right?"**

Then use your digging work (the 5 Questions) to explore the block.

---

## üßò BODY SCAN FOR YES/NO

If you're unclear, do a quick body scan:

**Head:** Is there mental clarity or confusion?
**Throat:** Is it open or constricted?
**Chest:** Expanding or contracting?
**Stomach:** At ease or churning?
**Solar Plexus:** Warm or tight?
**Gut:** Peaceful or unsettled?
**Legs:** Grounded or restless?

**Any contraction anywhere = NOT a 100% YES**

---

## üíé ADVANCED: THE 80% YES TRAP

Beware of the "80% YES" - it seems good enough, but it's NOT.

**Signs of 80% YES:**
- "Well, it's pretty good..."
- "Most of it feels right..."
- "I can make it work..."
- "It's better than nothing..."
- "The pros outweigh the cons..."

**This is a NO trying to disguise itself.**

A real 100% YES needs NO convincing.

---

## üåà YOUR HIGHEST COMPASS

> **"Following what feels right will ultimately become your highest compass."**

Your higher self / spirit guides you through the sense of **what feels right**.

This is NOT:
- ‚ùå What you think you should do
- ‚ùå What others expect
- ‚ùå What seems logical
- ‚ùå What avoids discomfort

This IS:
- ‚úÖ What expands you
- ‚úÖ What aligns you
- ‚úÖ What your body says YES to
- ‚úÖ What your soul recognizes as true

---

## üî• THE SHADOW SIDE OF FOLLOWING YES

**Warning:** Following your 100% YES will bring up shadow and darkness from yourself and others.

**People will challenge you:**
- "Why are you being so selfish?"
- "You can't just do what you want!"
- "What about your responsibilities?"
- "You're hurting people by saying no!"

**Your own programming will resist:**
- Guilt for disappointing others
- Fear of being selfish
- Conditioning to please
- Belief that you "should" sacrifice

**Stay disciplined. Keep following the YES.**

This is how you become medicine.

---

**Week 2:** Add clothing and activity choices
**Week 3:** Practice on social invitations
**Week 4:** Apply to work decisions
**Month 2:** Use for bigger life choices

---

## üåü FINAL REMINDERS

> **"Anything that is not a 100% YES will create more harm than good."**

> **"You don't require knowing WHY something does NOT feel right."**

> **"Accept it and move on from it."**

> **"Your body knows. Trust it."**

---
