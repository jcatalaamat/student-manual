# Inner Ascend DAO: NFT + Governance System

## ‚ú® Vision & Mission

---

### üîÆ Vision

To protect human dignity, sovereign birthrights, and sacred living by creating a living sanctuary where people heal, learn, and live in regenerative harmony with the Earth ‚Äî planting seeds of true community for future generations.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Mission

We are building an intentional regenerative community ‚Äî a healing village, a real-life school, and an educational sanctuary ‚Äî that empowers self-sufficiency, emotional integrity, collective healing, and spiritual sovereignty. Through land regeneration, decolonized education, sacred remembrance, and decentralized self-governance, we are restoring humanity‚Äôs original instructions: to live in reciprocity with each other, the Earth, and the sacred.

### üîÑ Core Values

- **Regeneration**: Healing ecosystems, cultures, and communities to restore sacred balance.
- **Sovereignty**: Defending bodily, emotional, spiritual, and communal self-determination.
- **Sacred Stewardship**: Living in right relationship with the Earth, ancestors, and each other.
- **Transparency**: Acting with honesty, accountability, and open-hearted governance.
- **Decentralized Community**: Organizing life collectively, cooperatively, and without reliance on external power structures.
- **Equity & Decolonization**: Honoring indigenous wisdom, repairing systemic harm, and creating inclusive pathways for all.
- **Truth & Dignity**: Holding unwavering commitment to human integrity, emotional honesty, and the defense of life.

### üî´ Strategic Goals

- Secure land in Oaxaca and establish DAO legal structure
- Raise \$1.5M to develop full eco-infrastructure and DAO system
- Establish NFT-based access and funding tiers to support scalability and sovereignty
- Build physical sanctuary in 3 phases: land, build, activate
- Serve 200+ seasonal members annually and 15-30 long-term stewards
- Launch a digital DAO platform to connect global members and fund future sanctuaries

## üìÖ Project Overview

---

### üíº Business Model

We are a nonprofit land-based sanctuary funded through NFT contributions, retreat revenues, memberships, and aligned partnerships. The model reinvests 100% of income into regeneration, education, and sanctuary operations. NFTs grant tiered access and governance rights within the DAO. No speculative resale; access is sacred, not commodified.

### üìñ Target Communities

- Conscious entrepreneurs & founders
- Healers, facilitators, ceremonial leaders
- Families seeking alternative education
- Regenerative builders, artists, storytellers
- DAO-native Web3 contributors
- Digital nomads and de-growth seekers

### üîÑ Development Phases

1. **Foundation**: Land acquisition + Phase 1 NFT funding
2. **Infrastructure**: Eco-construction + DAO governance
3. **Activation**: Launch residencies, retreats, DAO operations
4. **Expansion**: New sanctuaries, digital learning platform, ecosystem partnerships

### üìç Key Objectives

- Raise \$500‚Äì\$700K to secure land
- Raise \$1M+ to build core eco-village structures
- Onboard 500+ members via NFT sales in 2‚Äì3 years
- Deliver regenerative programs to 1,000+ people annually (onsite + online)
- Launch Inner Ascend DAO governance platform by end of Year 2

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Documentation

### ü™ô NFT System

### Membership Tiers

NFT tiers grant symbolic and functional rights based on contribution. Each wallet may hold one NFT, which can evolve over time:

| **Tier** | **Contribution** | **Rights** | **Access** | **Governance** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Founding Steward | \$10K | Founding voice + DAO vote | 2 weeks/year | Weighted vote (x3) |
| Builder Resident | \$25K+ | Right to build/stay longer | 1 month/year | Weighted vote (x2) |
| Seasonal Guest | \$3.5‚Äì5K | Short-term stay access | 5‚Äì10 days/year | Partial vote (x1) |
| Guardian Ally | \$108‚Äì500 | Digital access only | Online only | No vote |
| Sponsor Partner | \$25‚Äì100K+ | Brand + team access | Custom | Strategic voice (non-voting) |

### Access Rights

All access is token-gated using platforms like **Unlock Protocol**, **Guild.xyz**, or a custom booking app. DAO members book stays through a shared seasonal calendar. Access is prioritized by tier. Some slots are reserved for ceremonies, staff, or service exchanges.

### Transfer Rules

- NFTs are **non-transferable** for 12 months (soulbound during first year)
- After that, transfers must be approved by the DAO
- Upgrades are tracked via **on-chain metadata updates** or paired **soulbound side tokens**

### Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1 mint: Founding Stewards only (limited quantity)
2. Custom DAO dashboard & token-gated access portal
3. Public Phase 2 mint: Builders + Seasonal Guests
4. Build integration with calendar/stay credit system
5. NFT upgrade interface for cumulative contributions

    - Voting participation
    - Contributions (financial, labor, service)
    - Hosting, teaching, building
- Members earn badges and role multipliers (e.g. Healer, Guardian, Architect)

### Voting Mechanisms
