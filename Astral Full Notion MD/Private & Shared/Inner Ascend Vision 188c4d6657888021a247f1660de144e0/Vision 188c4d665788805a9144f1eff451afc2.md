# Vision

## **Overall Model Recap**

You are creating:

- **A real sanctuary** rooted in land-based regeneration and sacred learning
- **A DAO** as the cultural and governance layer
- **NFTs** to symbolize sacred access, roles, and co-creation
- **A utility token** to enable internal circulation, contribution, rewards, and voting

You are not creating:

- A speculative token economy
- A DAO where the land is fractionalized and sold
- A profit-driven real estate project

---

## **🌱 DAO Structure: “The Circle of Stewards”**

### **🛠️ Legal Base**

- Mexican ONG (non-profit) is the legal owner/steward of the land.
- DAO is **integrated with** the NGO to ensure transparency and collective governance.
- DAO has no legal claim over the land but governs **access, co-creation, funding, and cultural decisions.**

### **🫶 Who can join the DAO?**

- Founding Members (NFT holders)
- Residents
- Core Contributors (digital or on-site)
- Vision Allies (off-site support)
- Some roles require onboarding/interview to align with values

### **🗳 Governance Logic**

- **One-person, one-vote** for major decisions
- Weighted token voting **for resource allocation** or proposals (e.g. 1 utility token = 1 voice for funding flow or program curation)
- Soft governance inspired by sociocracy or consent-based models

### **📋 DAO Votes Cover:**

- What programs/events get funded or prioritized
- Who gets invited into new roles or residency
- Fund allocation from the treasury (via Gnosis Safe or similar)
- Project milestones and values-related decisions

---

## **🎟️ NFT Structure: “Access & Recognition”**

### **🧬 What NFTs Represent**

Your NFTs are not speculative assets. They’re **symbolic access passes and role contracts.** Each tier gets a soul-bound or semi-soul-bound NFT (non-transferrable or only transferrable with DAO consent).

### **🪢 Proposed NFT Tiers**

| **NFT** | **Role** | **Utility** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🪷 **Founding Guardian** NFT | Anchor stewards ($100–150k) | Land use rights, DAO membership, lifetime access |
| 🌿 **Core Contributor** NFT | $50–75k | Shared home access, DAO voice, part-time residency |
| 🔥 **Vision Ally** NFT | $10–25k | Governance voice, lifetime digital access, recognition |
| 🌱 **Sacred Supporter** NFT | $250–3000 | Membership access, discounts, ceremonial roles |

Each NFT:

- Unlocks access to DAO voting
- Grants access to specific retreats/events/education
- Can be soulbound or upgradeable (e.g., supporter → contributor)

Optional:

- NFTs can have unique ceremonial artwork that evolves over time as people engage more.

## **🔁 Utility Token: “SALVA” (or “ASCEND”)**

### **🎯 Purpose of Token**

- Not a speculative investment asset
- Used inside the sanctuary economy and DAO
- Tracks regenerative contributions (proof-of-impact)

### **💡 Token Uses**

| **Use Case** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| 🔄 **Exchange** | Used for booking stays, retreats, educational programs |
| 🗳 **Voting** | Some votes weighted by token holding (e.g., project funding proposals) |
| 🌍 **Staking for Regeneration** | Token holders can stake tokens to support specific impact goals (tree planting, education) and receive rewards |
| 🌾 **Rewards** | Contributors and builders earn tokens for effort, teaching, service |
| 🛠️ **DAO proposals** | Propose new activities, budgets, or events inside the DAO |

### **📦 Tokenomics**

| **Type** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| Total Supply | Fixed (e.g., 100 million tokens) |
| Distribution | 20% Founders, 10% Reserve, 30% ReFi Fundraising Rewards, 20% Community Treasury, 20% Ecosystem Development |
| Value Flow | Tied to participation and regeneration outcomes, not speculation |

## **📈 Token Growth = Regeneration Impact**

Token and NFT value should increase with:

- Amount of land regenerated
- Amount of lives touched (healing, education)
- DAO participation
- Real-world impact metrics

You can optionally use platforms like [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/) or [Open Forest Protocol](https://www.openforestprotocol.org/) to **verify and tokenize ecological impact**, linking this directly to token circulation.

---

## **🔥 Best ReFi Launch Scenario**

**Phase 1 – Seed DAO + Founding NFT Mint**

- Invite first 50 Founding Guardians and Vision Allies via private mint (KYC + onboarding)
- Soulbound NFTs distributed via tools like [Unlock Protocol](https://unlock-protocol.com/)
- DAO governance activated with shared decisions

**Phase 2 – Utility Token Launch + ReFi Round**

- Launch SALVA token with Giveth, Gitcoin, or ReFi DAO
- Offer staking for regeneration milestones
- Contributors can receive SALVA rewards based on support (work, referrals, land service)

**Phase 3 – Onboarding Platform**

- Build a portal where people can:
    - Connect wallet
    - Apply for DAO membership
    - Mint NFTs based on tier
    - Access private areas, vote, book offerings

---

## **🔐 Key Tools / Platforms**

| **Tool** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| **Gnosis Safe** | Treasury control (multi-sig for transparency) |
| **DAOhaus** or **Aragon** | DAO governance logic |
| **Unlock Protocol** | NFT-based access control |
| **Regen Network** | Ecological impact tracking |
| **Gitcoin** / **Giveth** / **ReFi DAO** | Fundraising through regenerative grants |
| **Snapshot** | Token-based voting system |
| **Open Forest Protocol** | Carbon/regen validation for ReFi alignment |

---

## **✅ Summary: Keep it Soulful + Simple**

Yes — your instinct is absolutely right:

- **NFT = Access, Role, Belonging**
- **Utility Token = Internal Energy + Reward**
- **DAO = Collective Culture & Decisions**

The model works beautifully when the token is:

- **Non-speculative**
- **Rooted in real work**
- **Bridges spiritual, ecological, and technical integrity**
