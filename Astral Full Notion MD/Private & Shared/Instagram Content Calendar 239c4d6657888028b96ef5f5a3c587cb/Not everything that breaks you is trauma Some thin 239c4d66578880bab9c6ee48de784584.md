Not everything that breaks you is trauma. Some things are supposed to.”

—

It wasn’t a wound.

It was a doorway.

But because it hurt,

you called it damage.

You tried to process it.

Fix it.

Reframe it.

But what if this wasn’t something to understand?

What if this was the moment your story collapsed

so your soul could return?

—

Some things aren’t meant to be healed.

They’re meant to undo you.

To crack your voice.

To kill the roles.

To leave you on the floor,

not as a victim —

but as someone who finally stopped pretending.

—

This is what we don’t say enough:

Not all collapse is pathology.

Some of it is truth,

arriving louder than you asked for.

Let it wreck you.

Let it strip the structure.

Let it teach you the difference

between falling apart

and coming home.

—

If this hit somewhere deep,

sit with it in silence.

Or say “I know this” in the comments — for those who are still afraid to name it.
