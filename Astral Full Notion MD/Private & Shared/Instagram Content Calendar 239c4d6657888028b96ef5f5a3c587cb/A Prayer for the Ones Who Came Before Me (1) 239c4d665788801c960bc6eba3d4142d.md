# A Prayer for the Ones Who Came Before Me (1)

I call upon the blood in my bones,
The names I’ll never know,
The hands that carried me here
through fire, silence, war, and forgetting.

To the mothers who could not rest,
To the fathers who never felt safe,
To the children inside them who were never seen—
I see you now.

I feel you now.

Let this breath be yours.
Let this body be your altar.
Let this day be the day
a thousand years of pain begin to soften.

I am here to remember.
To feel what was unfelt.
To forgive what was unforgivable.
To return what was never mine to carry.

Let this be enough.

I do not need to know all the stories.
I just need to feel them fully.
And when I do, may the cords unwind
through every root, every cell, every echo.

May your suffering find its voice through me,
And may I find my freedom
by setting you free.

I forgive you.
I forgive myself.
I release the shame.
I return to love.

And I walk forward,
as the first in my line
to remember what wholeness feels like.

So be it.
So it is.
I am the one.
