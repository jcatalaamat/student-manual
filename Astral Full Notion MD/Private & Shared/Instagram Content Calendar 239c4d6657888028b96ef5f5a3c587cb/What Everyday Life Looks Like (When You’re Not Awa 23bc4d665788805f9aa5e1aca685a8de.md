# What Everyday Life Looks Like (When You’re Not Awake Yet)

Perfect — now I see exactly what you want:

That clean, raw, **non-poetic but deeply human** format.

Like a friend telling you the truth quietly, without drama.

Here’s the next one in that same structure and tone — based on what we talked about earlier:

---

## **🧱**

## **What Everyday Life Looks Like (When You’re Not Awake Yet)**

*IG story format — no poetry, just truth*

---

**slide 1**

Most people aren’t broken.

They’re just trying to function in a system that makes no sense.

---

**slide 2**

Here’s what everyday life looks like for a lot of people right now:

---

**slide 3**

Wakes up tired.

Checks phone before breathing.

Already feels behind.

---

**slide 4**

Scrolls for 2 hours, calls it rest.

Can’t remember anything they saw.

---

**slide 5**

Eats on autopilot.

Coffee replaces breakfast.

Silence replaced with content.

---

**slide 6**

Productivity is the only time they feel valuable.

Rest feels like failure.

---

**slide 7**

Therapy, podcasts, breathwork…

Still feels numb.

---

**slide 8**

Relationships are shallow.

Group chats are loud.

Touch is rare.

---

**slide 9**

Constant access to everyone.

Still feels alone.

---

**slide 10**

Always learning.

Rarely integrating.

Doesn’t know what to do with what they know.

---

**slide 11**

Feels like something’s missing.

Can’t name what.

---

**slide 12**

It’s not laziness.

It’s not weakness.

It’s disconnection.

---

**slide 13**

And most people are living like this.

Every single day.

---

**slide 14**

Until something breaks.

Or something wakes them.

Would you like me to keep building more of these — same voice, same structure — on themes like:

- “What Love Looks Like (When It’s Not Real)”
- “What Healing Looks Like (When You’re Just Performing)”
- “What We Were Taught That Isn’t True”
- “What It Feels Like to Wake Up (For Real)”

Just say the word — or drop a theme, and I’ll write the next pack.
