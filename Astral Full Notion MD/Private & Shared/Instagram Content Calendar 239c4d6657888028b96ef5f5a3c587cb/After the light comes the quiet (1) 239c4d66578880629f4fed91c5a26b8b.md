After the light comes the quiet.”

—

Nobody tells you how tender it gets

after the breakthrough.

After the moment.

After the medicine.

After the remembering.

You sit in stillness.

No visions.

No words.

Just breath.

And maybe for the first time —

you don’t need to explain it.

—

There’s no urgency here.

No pressure to teach what you’ve seen.

No need to share, to shape, or to speak.

Just the soft return

to what you’ve always been.

—

If you’re in that space —

gentle, hollow, whole —

stay a while.

Let it root.

Let it settle.

Let it become the way you walk.
