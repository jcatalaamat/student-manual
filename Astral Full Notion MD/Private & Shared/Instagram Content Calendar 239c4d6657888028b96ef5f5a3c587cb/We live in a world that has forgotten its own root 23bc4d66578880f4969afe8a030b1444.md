It tells me this:

We live in a world that has **forgotten its own roots**.

A world where **control replaced connection**,

and **shame replaced sacredness**.

---

## **🧱 We built a world on top of fear:**

- We **institutionalized love**, so it could be taxed, inherited, controlled.
- We **criminalized bodies** — especially female, queer, and fluid ones.
- We **moralized sex**, turning something natural into something dirty.
- We **fragmented community**, making couples carry what villages once held.
- We **medicalized emotion**, **capitalized desire**, and **outsourced wisdom**.

> We turned fire into screens. Ritual into algorithm.
> 

> Touch into transaction. Union into performance.
>

## **😔 So what happened?**

We inherited a system built on:

- **Patriarchy**
- **Religious control**
- **Colonial trauma**
- **Capitalism**
- **Industrial extraction**
- **Fear of nature (and of the feminine)**

These systems told us:

- Your body is dangerous.
- Your desire must be controlled.
- Your value is your productivity.
- Your love must be exclusive and legal.
- Your grief, rage, pleasure, and truth are inconvenient.

> And we believed it. Because we were lonely. Because we forgot.
>

## **🌿 But under all this?**

There’s still the **wild memory**:

- That love is not ownership.
- That sex is not sin.
- That healing is not diagnosis.
- That community is not content.
- That the body is a **portal**, not a problem.

> The old ways live in your bones.
> 

> You ache not because something’s wrong —
> 

> but because something sacred is trying to return.
>

## **🌕 So what does this tell me?**

That we are in the **great remembering**.

Right now, in this very generation:

- People are questioning marriage, monogamy, gender, success, power.
- They are returning to the land. To ritual. To honesty.
- They are learning to say:
    - “I don’t want to perform anymore.”
    - “I want truth, not perfection.”
    - “I want to feel safe in my skin.”
    - “I want to love without cages.”

> This tells me we are still becoming human again.

Would you like me to write this as a sacred call, a voiceover for a short film, or a scroll for your temple offering?
