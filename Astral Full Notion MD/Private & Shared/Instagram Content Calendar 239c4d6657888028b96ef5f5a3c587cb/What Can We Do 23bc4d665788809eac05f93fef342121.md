Got it â€” no poetry, just raw, real, **clear** â€” almost like youâ€™re looking someone in the eye and telling the truth. Hereâ€™s your **IG story-style series** â€” stripped-down, honest, straight to the point:

### **ðŸ”¥ What Can We Do? (IG story format â€” no poetry, just truth)**

---

**slide 1**

We live in a system that disconnected us from ourselves, from others, and from the Earth.

---

**slide 2**

We inherited shame, fear, and rules that donâ€™t fit who we really are.

---

**slide 3**

But we can choose something else.

Hereâ€™s what we can actually do:

---

**slide 4**

1. Stop believing your emotions are wrong.
    
    Youâ€™re not broken. Youâ€™re responding to a broken system.
    

---

**slide 5**

2. Bring presence back into everyday life.

Ritual isnâ€™t weird. Itâ€™s how humans remember what matters.

---

**slide 6**

3. Build relationships that are honest, not performative.

Drop the pressure to fit a model. Start being real.

---

**slide 7**

4. Come back to your body.

You canâ€™t heal disconnected.

Feel it. Move it. Let it speak.

---

**slide 8**

5. Create community â€” even if itâ€™s just 2 or 3 people who get it.

Thatâ€™s how it starts.

---

**slide 9**

6. Raise children differently.

Or help raise someone elseâ€™s.

We donâ€™t need perfect parents â€” we need safe adults.

---

**slide 10**

7. Question everything.

Who benefits from your shame?

Who profits from your numbness?

---

**slide 11**

8. Make art that means something.

Stop trying to go viral.

Start trying to be honest.

---

**slide 12**

9. Protect whatâ€™s sacred.

Nature. Connection. Truth.

Turn down the noise. Choose what matters.

---

**slide 13**

You donâ€™t need a 10-step plan.

You just need to start where you are.

And stop pretending this is normal.

---

**slide 14**

You already know whatâ€™s true.

Now live like it.
