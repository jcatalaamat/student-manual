# Grieving the Old Self That Still Wants to Live

“Some parts of you don’t want to die. They want to be loved.”

—

Even after all the healing,

the ceremonies,

the ego deaths —

some old patterns still show up.

The ones that want to be chosen.

The ones that crave punishment.

The ones that don’t know life

without pain.

—

It’s easy to shame those parts.

To call them “ego.”

To exile them from your new identity.

But what if they’re not in the way?

What if they’re just… grieving?

They’ve been with you forever.

They kept you alive.

They don’t want to die.

They want to be seen.

—

This isn’t another release.

It’s a reunion.

And sometimes

integration looks like holding

what you thought you had to kill.
