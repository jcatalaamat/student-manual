“You don’t get to meet God without meeting the parts of you that begged to forget.”

People say it’s bliss.
They say it’s light.
They say they “touched Source” and now everything is love.

But the ones who’ve really gone —
who’ve died there,
who’ve seen their name disintegrate into ash —
they don’t say much at all.

Because there aren’t words.
Only tears.
Only silence.
Only the sound of your nervous system trying to reassemble a self
from what’s left after truth.
