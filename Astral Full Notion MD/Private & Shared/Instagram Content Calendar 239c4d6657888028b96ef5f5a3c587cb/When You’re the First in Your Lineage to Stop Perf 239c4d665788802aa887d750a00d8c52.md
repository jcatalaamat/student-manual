# When You’re the First in Your Lineage to Stop Performing

“You weren’t born to continue the show.”

—

You were the one who said:

“No more pretending.”

No more smiling through the ache.

No more contorting for approval.

No more holding everyone else’s emotions

while your own go unheard.

—

You feel it, don’t you?

That invisible weight.

The expectation to make everyone comfortable

at the expense of your own truth.

You didn’t ask for that role.

But you’ve played it well.

Until now.

—

There’s grief in stepping out of the performance.

You might lose connection.

You might lose language.

You might lose the love that was only given

when you were good.

But what you gain

is the self you were never allowed to be.

—

You’re not dramatic.

You’re just the first one to stop lying.
