# DAILY RHYTHM

Great — let’s build you a sacred, structured calendar routine that integrates:

- 👨‍👩‍👧 Time with your family
- 💻 Focus blocks for work or creative projects
- 🧘‍♂️ Personal well-being (movement, rest, integration)
- 📈 Trading (4H/1D swing style — minimal time)
- ✍️ Optional content creation, rituals, or spiritual practices

# **🌞 DAILY RHYTHM (Example Template)**

Here’s a structure you can modify depending on your toddler’s nap, nanny schedule, and your own energy:

| **Time** | **Focus** |
| --- | --- |
| 6:00 – 7:30am | Wake up, light movement, family time, breakfast |
| 7:30 – 8:00am | Morning walk with toddler (presence, joy) |
| 8:00 – 9:30am | Partner’s solo time → you with toddler |
| 9:30 – 12:00pm | Your solo block (deep work or trading check) |
| 12:00 – 1:00pm | Lunch, reset, light house tasks |
| 1:00 – 3:00pm | Toddler nap → solo block (creative or admin) |
| 3:00 – 6:00pm | Shared time, nanny slot or partner swaps |
| 6:00 – 7:30pm | Evening walk, unwind, toddler bedtime |
| 7:30 – 9:30pm | Couple time / solo wind-down / spiritual work |
| 9:30pm+ | Rest, no screens — recover deeply |

# **🔁 WEEKLY OVERVIEW (Sacred Flow)**

| **Day** | **Focus & Energy** |
| --- | --- |
| Monday | Weekly planning + mark trading zones (30min) |
| Tuesday | Creative work + enter swing trades if setup appears |
| Wednesday | Review trade status + client/coaching/admin |
| Thursday | Continue focus work or rest depending on energy |
| Friday | Exit trades if in profit + light review of week |
| Saturday | Full family day / rest / nature / integration |
| Sunday | Chart review + life check-in + calendar prep |

# **⏳ Add-On Rhythms You Can Weave In**

- 🧘‍♂️ Morning anchor: Breath + intention (5–15min)
- 📓 Evening reflection: What opened today? What closed?
- 🔔 Trading alerts only: Don’t stare at charts — let them call you
- 📱 Content creation (1x/week, optional): share from overflow, not pressure

# **Want this in Notion or Google Calendar?**

I can send you:

- A Notion routine board (drag & drop template)
- A Google Calendar example layout (with blocks for each item)
- A visual PDF cheat sheet of your weekly rhythm

Just say:

“Build my full calendar kit” — and I’ll start crafting it.

Perfect — let’s organize everything into one clear visual dashboard-style overview you can either:

- Print and stick on a wall
- Copy into Notion or Calendar
- Follow without overwhelm

This will include:
