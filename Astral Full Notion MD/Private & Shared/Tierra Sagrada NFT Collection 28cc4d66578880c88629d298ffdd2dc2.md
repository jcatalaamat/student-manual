### **The Reality Check:**

**What You Can ACTUALLY Deliver:**

1. **Physical access to real land** (you're buying 12 acres)
2. **Accommodation** (start with camping/glamping, build up)
3. **Community** (Discord/WhatsApp groups start immediately)
4. **Events** (workshops are easy once you have the space)
5. **Food** (permaculture gardens produce real food)

**What's Borderline/Future:**

- Profit sharing (depends on success)
- Luxury amenities (bio-pool, etc)
- Full governance rights (need legal structure)

### **Comparable Real-World Examples:**

**Soho House Membership**: $3,000-5,000/year

- Access to houses globally
- Booking privileges
- Events and community

**Selina CoLive**: $450-1,500/month

- Accommodation in Latin America
- Coworking spaces
- Community events

**Traditional Timeshares**: $20,000+ buy-in

- 1-2 weeks per year
- No real ownership
- High maintenance fees

**Your NFTs are basically**: **Decentralized Soho House meets Timeshare meets Kickstarter**

### **The Honest Pitch:**

"Buy an NFT = **Reserve your spot** in a real regenerative village being built in Oaxaca. You're funding the development AND securing member benefits. It's part crowdfunding, part membership, part investment in a new way of living."

### **Minimum Viable Benefits (Start Here):**

1. **Accommodation nights** (easy to deliver)
2. **Community access** (Discord is free)
3. **Booking priority** (just a spreadsheet)
4. **Founding member status** (costs nothing)

Everything else can be added as you grow.

**The key:** People are buying into a **vision and community**, not just transaction benefits. They want to be part of building something meaningful.

Does this feel realistic and deliverable for what you're planning to build?
