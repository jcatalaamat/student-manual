# Proyecto Salvaje Protocol

**üåÄ INNER ASCEND PROTOCOL**

A sacred contribution framework for Proyecto Salvaje ‚Äî a living sanctuary on the Pacific coast of Oaxaca.

# **1. Why We Are Here**

We are building a regenerative village and living school dedicated to restoring human dignity, sovereignty, and sacred relationship with the Earth ‚Äî through community, education, healing, and embodied remembrance.

This is not a wellness retreat.

This is a shelter for truth. A sanctuary for those who still remember. A field of restoration for what it means to live well, together, with the Earth.

The land ‚Äî 5 hectares on the coast of Oaxaca ‚Äî is privately held in sacred trust. What we offer is not ownership, but place. Not profit, but participation. Not escape, but embodiment.

# **2. Land Contribution Model**

We are calling in Founding Members to become part of this sanctuary‚Äôs creation. Every contribution is a sacred investment into the land, the people, and the future we are building together.

All members enter through relationship, shared values, and a clear agreement.

**üü´ $50,000 ‚Äì Resident Plot Ownership**

This is the base contribution to become a founding resident of Proyecto Salvaje.

You receive:

- Ownership of a private eco-home plot (~400‚Äì600m¬≤)
- The right to build and inhabit your home, in alignment with ecological and cultural guidelines
- Lifetime access to communal infrastructure: kitchen, water systems, gardens, temple, coworking dome
- A soulbound NFT representing your presence and land agreement
- Participation in the rhythms of the sanctuary

This contribution is for those who want to live on the land ‚Äî not as investors or guests, but as guardians. It includes land, but not governance or financial returns.

**‚óæ $75,000‚Äì$100,000 ‚Äì Community Co-Creator**

For those who wish to own land and contribute to the building of the sanctuary‚Äôs shared spaces, DAO system, and cultural foundation.

**‚óºÔ∏è $150,000+ ‚Äì Anchor Steward & Founding Circle**

# **6. Sacred Belonging**

This is not a transaction.

This is a transmission.

To contribute is to belong ‚Äî not just to the land, but to a lineage of restoration.

We are not selling land.

We are restoring it ‚Äî with you.

If you feel called, we invite you to step forward.

If you‚Äôre uncertain, we invite you to sit with the land and ask.

We are ready.

We are listening.
