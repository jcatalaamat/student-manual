Don’t confuse tools with presence.”

—

A practice is not presence.

A routine is not listening.

A protocol is not intimacy.

You can meditate every day

and still avoid the part of you that’s crying.

You can journal every morning

and never touch the grief in your belly.

You can learn all the language

and never speak a single word that’s true.

So much of healing is

stopping everything that looks like healing

until what’s real can finally land.

No technique.

No filter.

Just your breath,

your ache,

and a mirror that doesn’t move.
