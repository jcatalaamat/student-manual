You’re not broken.
You’re just living out a system that was never yours to begin with.

Let that land.

You weren’t born disconnected, doubting, ashamed, scared to feel.
You were taught that.

By a world that thrives on your suppression.
By a lineage that never had the tools.
By patterns that repeat until someone brave enough says:

“It ends with me.”

Healing is not a trend.
It’s not an aesthetic.
It’s not a yoga pose or a cacao ceremony.

It’s holding the trembling part of you that was never met.
It’s letting your insides break open without apologizing.
It’s doing the digging when everyone else says “just move on.”

You will not find God in a clean white room.
You will find Her in your rage.
In your sobs.
In the part of you that’s still screaming for the love it never got.

Read that again.

This work is sacred.
Not because it looks pretty —
but because it’s the only thing that’s ever been real.

This is your revolution.
And it doesn’t come with a plan.
It comes when you decide to stop bypassing and start listening.

Listening to the small voice.
To the forgotten ache.
To the ancient Yes.

🌀
There’s a version of you on the other side of this.
Lighter.
Wilder.
Whole.

You’ve met them in dreams.
Now go become them.
