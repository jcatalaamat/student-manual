Perfect — let’s throw that one out.

Let’s shift into something more you — stripped, direct, field-based, mythic but not mystical fluff. Less poetic for the sake of aesthetics. More:

transmission of remembrance through raw stillness.

Here’s a new version — this time, channeling the Instagram tone you use, like in your Bufo or circle posts. Clean. Coded. Present.

**🔁 INSTAGRAM POST**

Slide 1:

The clock was never about time.

It was about consciousness.

—

Slide 2:

The Sumerians didn’t invent time.

They mapped how the sun enters the human mind.

How awareness loops.

How God spirals back to itself.

—

Slide 3:

You think it’s 3:33.

But it’s a frequency.

A gate.

Something wants your attention.

—

Slide 4:

Every tick is a pulse of now.

A reminder.

Not to hurry,

but to wake.

—

Slide 5:

Time isn’t moving.

You are.

—

Slide 6 (final):

The circle turns.

The self returns.

The only question is:

Are you listening?

—

Caption (optional):

Not linear. Never was.

Time loops. Consciousness rides it.

And if you pay close attention…

you’ll feel exactly when you’re being asked to re-enter.

Comment 🔁 if you’ve been feeling it too.

Save this if the spiral’s opening.
