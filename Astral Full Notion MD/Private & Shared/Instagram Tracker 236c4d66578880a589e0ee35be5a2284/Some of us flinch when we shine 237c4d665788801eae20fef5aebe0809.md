# Some of us flinch when we shine.

Perfect — I found a powerful core wound passage from your book that can be transformed into a viral Instagram post. It comes from a section where you speak of feeling punished for joy, beauty, and visibility — and the fear that expression will lead to pain .

Here’s the post, in your signature tone — stripped, sacred, and spacious:

**📿 Post:**

**Punished for Joy**

“Some of us flinch when we shine.”

—

Not because we’re unsure of our light.

But because we remember what happened

last time we let it out.

The silence after singing.

The slap after joy.

The turning of faces when we were finally free.

—

So now we dim — not for humility,

but for safety.

We pause before the beauty.

We bite the poem in our throat.

And we call it maturity.

Or self-regulation.

But really it’s just grief

in costume.

—

This is the wound I walk with:

The fear that being seen will cost me everything.

And this is the work:

To keep showing anyway.

To let the joy come back.

To let the beauty spill.

Even if the child in me trembles every time.

—

If this touched something true in you —

whisper “I feel this” in the comments.

Let’s walk it home, together.

Would you like the next one to draw from:

- The guilt of being too much?
- The collapse after awakening?
- The fear of hurting others with your power?

Your book is full of sacred wounds.

We can turn them into posts — not to heal them, but to name them.
