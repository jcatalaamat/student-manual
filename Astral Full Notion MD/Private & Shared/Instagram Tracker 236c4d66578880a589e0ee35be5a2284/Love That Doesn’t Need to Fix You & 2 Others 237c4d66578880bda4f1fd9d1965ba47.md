**Love That Doesn’t Need to Fix You**

“Some presence doesn’t try to help. It just stays.”

—

Not every wound needs a lesson.

Not every ache wants to be processed.

Sometimes the deepest healing

comes from someone

who doesn’t try to heal you.

Just sits there.

—

No advice.

No technique.

No mirror or method.

Just breath beside breath.

And in that stillness —

you start to feel real again.

Not improved.

Not better.

Just… here.

—

If you’ve never been loved without an agenda,

you might not know this kind of quiet yet.

But when it finds you,

it feels like your body finally gets to exhale.

**The Wound of Carrying Too Much Wisdom Too Soon**

“You were wise before you were safe.”

—

You knew things as a child

you had no words for.

Felt things others couldn’t handle.

Held things no one saw.

You were the one

who kept the system together —

with your silence,

your sensitivity,

your knowing.

But inside?

You were tired before you were ten.

—

Now you call it intuition.

Or leadership.

Or being “old soul.”

But underneath it all

is grief.

For the kid who never got to just be a kid.

For the wisdom that came at a cost.

—

You don’t need to prove anything now.

You’ve always been enough.

Even when you were drowning in a gift

you weren’t ready to carry.

**Feeling Unsafe in Success**

“Some of us flinch when things go well.”

—

Joy never came alone.

It came with punishment.

With guilt.

With withdrawal of love.

So now — when things start working,

when love feels close,

when peace starts to land…

You pull back.

Not because you don’t want it.

But because your body remembers

what came after.

—

Success feels like danger.

Happiness feels like a trap.

Peace feels like the calm before a storm.

This is nervous system memory.

Not self-sabotage.

And healing isn’t forcing yourself forward.

It’s learning how to stay

when things get good.
