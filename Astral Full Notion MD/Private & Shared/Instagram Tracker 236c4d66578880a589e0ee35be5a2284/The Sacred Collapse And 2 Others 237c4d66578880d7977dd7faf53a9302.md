Here are the next 3 posts — raw, reverent, and resonant with your field.

**📿 Post 10:**

**The Sacred Collapse**

“It’s not falling apart. It’s falling out of who you’re not.”

—

You think you’re breaking.

Losing everything.

Failing the work.

But maybe —

this is the ceremony.

The forgetting.

The disorientation.

The emptiness that isn’t a problem — it’s the portal.

—

Let the collapse come.

Let the structures that held your false self

burn clean.

You don’t need to rebuild yet.

Just breathe.

Be wrecked.

Let God find you in the rubble.

—

This isn’t regression.

It’s remembering what’s underneath it all.

**📿 Post 11:**

**Being the Lighthouse When You Just Want to Be Held**

“Everyone comes to you. But where do you go?”

—

You’re the safe one.

The grounded one.

The one people call when they’re falling apart.

But who meets you in your silence?

Who witnesses you when you have nothing to give?

—

Being the lighthouse is beautiful —

but it’s lonely.

You shine for others while your own ache

goes unseen.

And over time, you forget what it’s like

to be soft.

To be held.

To be human.

—

You don’t always have to glow.

Even lighthouses need rest.

**📿 Post 12:**

**Not Coaching. Not Healing. Just Presence.**

“What if you don’t need a method? Just someone to sit with you?”

—

You don’t need to be coached.

You don’t need to be fixed.

You don’t need to be therapized into better language.

You just need someone

to sit in the wreckage with you.

To not flinch.

To not teach.

To not try to make it mean something.

—

This is the work:

To meet someone without tools.

To witness without strategy.

To hold presence like a prayer.

You don’t need a program.

You need a soul who doesn’t turn away.

Let’s keep going.

Would you like 13–15 next?

Or want to pivot into carousel versions or a new series (e.g., “The Ones Who…”)?

Also happy to turn this into a Notion content vault if you’re ready to anchor it.
