# The Threshold Path - Details

**6-Month Mentorship for souls in sacred rupture**

---

## What This Is

This isn't for growth. It's for undoing. For remembering. For those dissolving, awakening, remembering—those who cannot go back.

A 6-month journey of deep companionship for souls in the midst of profound spiritual emergence, identity dissolution, or sacred rupture from consensus reality.

---

## Who This Is For

### Souls who are:

- **Dissolving, unraveling, or shedding** old identities completely
• **Newly awakened** and unsure how to live in the world now
• **Ready for presence, not performance** or spiritual bypassing
• **Experiencing spiritual emergency/emergence** and need grounded support
• **Called to live from a completely different paradigm** but don't know how
• **In sacred rupture** with family systems, career paths, or life structures

### You might be:

- Feeling like an alien in your own life
• Experiencing profound shifts in perception or consciousness
• Unable to return to "normal" after awakening experiences
• Feeling called to embody something completely new
• Navigating the death of who you thought you were

---

## The 6-Month Container

### Biweekly Sessions

- **12 x 75-minute sessions** spaced every two weeks
• **Consistent rhythm** for deep process integration
• **Zoom or voice** based on what serves your nervous system
• **Sacred witnessing** without agenda or timeline pressure

### Continuous Support

- **24/7 soul support** via Telegram or Signal
• **Real-time guidance** during intense passages
• **Voice message exchanges** for nuanced communication
• **Emergency sessions** if needed during crisis moments

### Living Documentation

- **Living Portal Document** - a growing archive of insights, revelations, and integration points from our work together
• **Soul assignments** - gentle practices or inquiries (only if they feel aligned)
• **Timeline shifting support** - assistance navigating non-linear reality and quantum shifts

## What We'll Navigate Together

### The Death

Witnessing and honoring what's dying—old selves, belief systems, life structures, relationships that no longer serve your authentic being.

### The Void

Companionship in the dark night of the soul, the liminal space where nothing makes sense and everything is possible.

### The Rebirth

Midwifing whatever wants to be born through you, without rushing or forcing the emergence.

### The Integration

Supporting your embodiment of new ways of being in practical, grounded ways.

### The Sacred Rupture

Honoring your break from consensus reality and helping you navigate the world from your new paradigm.
