# 6-Week Deep Presence - Details

**For the ones walking through fire**

---

## What This Is

This is not a program. It's sacred companionship for the in-between—soul companionship in a season of becoming.

A 6-week container for those who need sustained presence through deep transition, spiritual emergence, or life reconfiguration.

---

## Who This Is For

- Souls walking through the fire of major life transitions
• Those experiencing spiritual emergence or awakening
• People integrating profound medicine experiences
• Anyone needing consistent support through collapse and rebirth
• Those ready for deep presence without pressure to "fix" or perform

---

## The Sacred Container

### Weekly Sessions

- **6 x 75-minute sessions** over 6 weeks
• **Consistent weekly rhythm** to create safety and continuity
• **Via Zoom or voice** based on your preference
• **No agenda beyond presence** and deep witnessing

### Ongoing Support

- **Daily or as-needed Telegram support** (text/voice)
• **Space for the raw and real** between sessions
• **Ceremony prep or integration** if plant medicines are part of your journey
• **Prayer, witnessing, reflection** as needed

## What We'll Hold Together

### The Unraveling

Space for whatever is falling apart, dissolving, or no longer serving. Permission to grieve, rage, or simply be in the unknown.

### The In-Between

Companionship in the liminal space where you're no longer who you were but not yet who you're becoming.

### The Emerging

Gentle witnessing of whatever wants to be born, without rushing or forcing the process.

### Integration

Support in embodying and grounding the shifts that want to anchor in your life.

---

## What This Isn't

- A coaching program with goals and outcomes
• Therapy or medical treatment
• A quick fix or transformation guarantee
• Performance-based or agenda-driven work

---

## What This Is

- Sacred witnessing without judgment
• Companionship at the edge of the unknown
• Space for your soul's authentic process
• Presence-based support for deep transition

---

## Investment

## Client Reflection

> "I'm very grateful I had the chance to experience this work with someone that clearly has the ability to listen (it's very rare) and make space for someone's soul. The 6 weeks gave me permission to fall apart and be held while I found my way back to myself—or to who I was becoming." — Nina
