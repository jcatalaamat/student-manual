# 30-Minute Clarity Call

**If you feel the call but don't know where to start**

---

## What This Is

A gentle, no-pressure conversation to feel into what's calling you and explore if this work is aligned for where you are now.

We'll meet in presence, listen together, slow down, and feel what's true.

---

## What We'll Explore

- **What's moving in your life** right now
â€¢ **What you're sensing** you might need support with

â€¢ **Which container** (if any) feels most aligned
â€¢ **Questions you have** about the work or approach
â€¢ **Mutual sensing** of whether we're meant to work together

---

## What This Isn't

- A sales call or pressure to commit
â€¢ A mini-session or abbreviated healing work
â€¢ A consultation about specific problems
â€¢ A guarantee that we'll work together

---

## What This Is

- Sacred discernment time for both of us
â€¢ Space to feel into resonance and timing
â€¢ Permission to explore without commitment
â€¢ Honoring that not every connection is meant to be

---

## The Approach

I move slowly. Nothing is rushed. There's no agenda beyond authentic connection and mutual clarity.

Some people know immediately if this work is for them. Others need time to feel into it. Both are perfectly honored.

---

## How This Works

### Before We Meet

- **Brief message exchange** about what's calling you
â€¢ **Scheduling** via simple calendar link or email coordination
â€¢ **Zoom or voice call** based on your preference

### During Our Call

- **Present moment connection** and feeling into what's alive
â€¢ **Gentle exploration** of what you're navigating
â€¢ **Natural conversation** about potential containers
â€¢ **Space for questions** and authentic curiosity

### After Our Call

- **No pressure** to decide immediately
â€¢ **Time and space** to feel into what's true for you
â€¢ **Open door** for follow-up questions if they arise

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What if I'm not ready to commit to longer work?**
Perfect. This call is about feeling into where you are now, not where you think you should be.

**What if I don't know how to articulate what I need?**
Even better. We'll feel into it together without needing to have it all figured out.

That's completely honored. Sometimes the clarity call is exactly what's needed.
