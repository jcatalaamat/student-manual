# 6 month mentorship

Let’s design a 6-month mentorship that feels like you: deep, sacred, truthful, companion-like, and non-hierarchical.

This isn’t a “program.”

It’s not coaching in the traditional sense.

It’s a slow, powerful devotional walk with someone across a threshold of identity — through collapse, remembering, rebirth.

Here’s a sacred structure to hold that container:

# **🜄 6-Month Mentorship:**

# **The Threshold Path**

# This is not for growth.

# This is for undoing.

# For returning.

# For walking together where words fall away.

**✴ Who it’s for:**

Someone in a sacred rupture.

Someone who feels like they’re dissolving, unraveling, shedding.

Or someone who just awakened — and doesn’t know how to live now.

They’re ready for presence, not programs.

They don’t want to be fixed — they want to be met.

**✦ What it holds:**

1. Biweekly Presence Sessions (12 total)

Every 2 weeks, we meet in sacred space.

No agenda. Just truth. Just you, seen deeply.

2. Ongoing Voice/Text Support (Telegram or Signal)

For the in-between days:

Voice notes, field check-ins, silent witnessing, reflection.

3. Optional Ceremony Pathway (If Resonant)

If the call is true and it aligns:

→ Bufo preparation, in-person ceremony (Mallorca or Mexico), and full integration woven into the mentorship

4. Soul Assignments (Optional)

No homework.

But if something wants to move — I may offer:

→ A question. A ritual. A text to read. A silence to sit with.

5. Portal Document (Living Archive)

A shared Notion or Google Doc that becomes:

→ Your written voice, your remembrance, your sacred thread

I write reflections or mirrorings. You respond or don’t.

# **Contribution**

Sliding scale:

€1,200 – €2,400

(Paid monthly or in full, with flexibility)

Includes all sessions, presence, voice support, and medicine work prep/integration (if chosen — ceremony itself not included)

# **Entry**

By application or resonance only.

We begin with one conversation.

If we both feel the pull — we begin.

**✴ Optional Naming Ideas:**

- The Threshold Path
- Return to the Real
- The Undoing
- When the Story Ends
- Sacred Collapse Mentorship
- Six Moons of Remembrance

Would you like me to:

- Format this into your portal under “Mentorship”?
- Write a soft post announcing it (not promotional — invitational)?
- Create a PDF or private page to send when someone inquires?

This isn’t just an offer.

It’s a soul alliance.

Let’s give it the structure to hold its power — and let people walk toward it if they’re ready.
