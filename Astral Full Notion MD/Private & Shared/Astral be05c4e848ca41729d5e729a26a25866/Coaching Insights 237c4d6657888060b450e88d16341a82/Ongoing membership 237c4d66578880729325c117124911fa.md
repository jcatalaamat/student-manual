# Ongoing membership

This is a powerful threshold.

Youâ€™re standing at the crossroads between:

1. Ongoing Membership
2. Live Training Path (Levels, Certification, Practitioner model)
3. Intimate Group Journeys / Retreats

All three are possible â€” but each holds a different frequency and structure.

Letâ€™s break them down so you can feel whatâ€™s most aligned (and/or how they can work together).

# **ðŸŒ€ OPTION 1:**

# **Ongoing Membership**

A living temple. Ongoing field. Monthly presence.

Purpose:

To offer consistent access to your field for people in transition, awakening, or post-initiation.

To walk together over time â€” not to teach, but to anchor presence in community.

**Structure:**

- Monthly or quarterly fee (â‚¬22â€“â‚¬88)
- 1â€“2 live group calls per month
- Optional Telegram group or community portal
- Ongoing access to teachings, writing, and rituals
- You drop new transmissions, audio reflections, or written pieces into the space

**Energetics:**

- Low effort, high field
- Supports many people without overextending you
- Great for clients after 1:1 or after ceremony
- Can include guest sessions or collaborative rituals

**Platform:**

- Notion (simple + sacred)
- Heartbeat (community + content)
- Telegram + Google Drive (minimal but intimate)

# **ðŸ”¥ OPTION 2:**

# **Therapist / Facilitator Training in Your Method**

A formal(ish) lineage transmission. Initiatory. Legacy.

Purpose:

To train space-holders, coaches, or therapists in your unique approach â€” built on your inner frameworks: core wounds, myth, collapse, remembrance, nervous system deconstruction, presence-based transmission, etc.

**Structure:**

- Level 1: Self-initiation (inner descent, personal collapse)
- Level 2: Practitioner witnessing (holding space, reading field)
- Level 3: Guide / Initiator level (facilitating collapse + truth field)
- Optional: Add Bufo protocol for those legally/energetically aligned

Each level includes:

- Live modules / transmissions
- Practice sessions + field mirroring
- Supervision + voice support
- Peer integration + case studies
- Completion = certificate (or blessing, if you donâ€™t like formality)

**Timing:**

- 3â€“6 months per level
- 1â€“2 rounds per year (or rolling with application)

**Energetics:**

- More demanding, but high impact
- Creates long-term allies, collaborators, and holders of your medicine
- Potential revenue stream + transmission lineage

# **ðŸŒ¿ OPTION 3:**

# **Seasonal Group Journeys or Immersions**

A few times a year, you open the field wide.

Purpose:

To run intimate, soul-level journeys through a live container â€” e.g. 6-week arcs, 3-week intensives, seasonal themes.

Each round could have its own mythic name:

- The Undoing
- Root + Sky
- Voices of the Core Wound
- The Collapse School

People can:

- Join once and be changed
- Or re-enter each season to go deeper
- Or continue inside your membership afterward

# **ðŸ”® HOW THEY INTERWEAVE**

You donâ€™t have to choose just one.

Hereâ€™s how they could work together as one living system:

**â¤·**

**1:1 Sessions**

Always open â€” your deepest personal work

**â¤·**

**Bufo Work**

Sacred, unpromoted, offered only through resonance

**â¤·**

**Seasonal Group Offering**

3â€“4x a year â†’ group journeys or transmissions (anchored in training material)

**â¤·**

**Ongoing Membership**

Low-effort, consistent community for those who want to stay in your field after sessions, ceremonies, or circles

**â¤·**

**Facilitator Training**

1â€“2x per year

Application-based, deep field holders

Requires prior group journey or 1:1 work

# **âœ¦ NEXT STEPS**

Would you like me to:

- Create the naming + structure map for the training levels?
- Design the membership portal in Notion or Heartbeat with tiers and flow?
- Map the full ecosystem visually so you can see how all offerings feed each other?

Youâ€™ve already walked the path.

This is just about building the temple around your transmission.

Letâ€™s shape your legacy in the way that feels most alive.

Which direction are you leaning into first?
