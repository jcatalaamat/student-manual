# Intention

I am interested in working on the following points:

1. Supporting mothers through motherhood.
2. Understanding child development stages.
3. Helping women through all stages of life.
4. Assisting men through different stages of life (which includes a child's developmental stages).
5. Nurturing relationships (partnerships, family members, and other connections) initiated by the mother or primary caretaker.

The goal is to address the following scenarios:

1. When a mother has concerns about her life, relationships, health, or her child.
2. When a father (or potential future father) wants to prepare for fatherhood or address childhood conditioning.
3. When children have health issues, developmental challenges (such as excessive phone use, distraction, ADHD, chronic conditions, strong personalities, or long-term diseases). In these cases, we work with the parents.
4. When a mother faces challenges in her role as a mother or primary caretaker. In such situations, we work with the parents, partner, support system, and environment.

In a way, I aim to be a "general GP practitioner" or "family doctor" who takes an integrative and paediatric approach. My intention is to promote the health and well-being of children for future generations, with a focus on addressing children's issues through their parents.

# Title breakdown

1. **Intuitive**: This suggests that you possess an inner wisdom or sense beyond the concrete and observable. As a healer, you're able to tap into this intuition to uncover deeper issues or imbalances that may not be immediately evident. This intuition guides your understanding of a family's unique dynamics, health challenges, and the path to their healing.
2. **Systemic**: This term signifies your recognition of families as interconnected systems, where each member influences and is influenced by the others. You understand that shifts in one part of the system can create ripples throughout the entire family unit. Therefore, your healing approach is not limited to treating individual symptoms; instead, you address the family system as a whole to facilitate more profound and sustainable healing.
3. **Family**: By specifying 'Family', you emphasize your focus on serving families as a unit. You understand the critical role family dynamics play in the health and well-being of each member, and this perspective guides your practice.
4. **Integrative**: This term suggests that your healing approach is holistic, drawing from various disciplines and practices. You might incorporate insights from transpersonal psychology, Ayurveda, Chinese medicine, and other holistic practices to offer a well-rounded approach to healing. This integration allows you to meet each family's unique needs and goals.
5. **Healer**: This term captures your role as a facilitator of healing. You're not merely treating symptoms; you're helping families discover and navigate their paths to overall well-being.

26. Seekers of spiritual growth: These are individuals who recognize the power of transcendence in healing. They understand that physical and emotional health is deeply connected to their spiritual well-being. They might be exploring meditation, mindfulness, or spiritual practices and are open to deepening their journey through your guidance.

## Making sure other people donâ€™t run away

1. Single individuals: Emphasize that your holistic healing approach is not exclusive to families. It's about personal growth and healing at all levels - physical, emotional, and spiritual. Mention that you help individuals understand their energy systems, uncover their soul's journey through the Akashic records, heal heartbreak, and navigate life transitions. Assure them that they don't need to be part of a family unit to seek your services.
2. Parents seeking help for their child: While you provide family integrative healing, stress that you also address individual needs. You understand that sometimes, a child may face issues that seem unrelated to the family. Explain that you offer support at all developmental stages, provide school support systems, and can assist with various challenges a child may be facing.
3. Single individuals who feel their journey has led them off the path. They are seeking the tools and support to regain their footing, reconnect with their core, and navigate life with renewed clarity and purpose.
4. Individuals eager to break through their current plateau, seeking guidance and strategies to catapult them into their next level of personal and spiritual growth.

Here are some ways you could express these points:

- "Your journey to wholeness begins here - whether you're an individual seeking balance and growth, a parent worried about your child, or a family wanting to foster healthier relationships. All are welcome."
- "Every individual is unique, every journey is different. Whether you're single, a concerned parent, or seeking collective family healing, I'm here to guide and support you."
- "From supporting the individual soul's journey to addressing the concerns of your child, to fostering wellness in families - I'm here for you. Your status doesn't define your right to healing and growth."
- "Healing has no prerequisites. Whether you're single, a parent concerned about your child's well-being, or a family seeking collective healing, I provide a supportive and nurturing space for all."
