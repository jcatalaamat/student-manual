# Practitioner Training - Foundations

## Preambule

### About the approach

The Inner Ascend Practitioner training is not a new healing modality. It is an approach to healing, growth and transformation that can include any other modality. You are free to embed only the transmissions that speak to you and embody them in your own way, with your own uniqueness. 

The approach is trauma informed and held in a heart-based container that supports vulnerability and authenticity.

### Our vision

### The pillars of the approach

- **The power of Contemplation**
- **Awakening Inner wisdom (self-sovereignty)**
- **Embracing Compassion**
- **Embodying Authenticity and Transparency**
- **Practicing Selfless service**

### Your intention as a practitioner

What is your intention as a practitioner? Do you want to help? Do you want to serve? To transform people’s life? Do you want to get people somewhere?

What do you personally wish to get out of becoming a practitioner?
Is it service? Is it love? Is it money? Success? Is it recognition? 

The clearer you intention get, the more refine your work can be. Refinement implies a purification of all the expectations, projections that are put on your client. 

The ultimate selfless service is for your clients to heal, grow, and free themselves so that they do not need you anymore. If you are the one needing your client for any reason, you are preventing them to free themselves from suffering.

## Nurtering self (r)evolution

### The Practice of Self Inquiry

The path to understanding other human beings goes through learning to understand yourself first. You are your first client and you know your personal story as no one else does. Practice being curious about what is going on for you at all time, giving attention to any emotional, physical or mental reaction, any trigger, any feeling arising. They are telling you something about yourself and wait to be unveiled through the light of your awareness. 

### Curiosity for the practices

The approach we offer transcends roles of teachers and students. We are all individually becoming the same Truth, the one of our inner nature. Everything that is proposed is an exploration path, an invitation to play, to be adventurous, to rejoice in the new. As you journey into the realms of your own intuition and discernment you will come to know what is best for you. We invite you to nurture curiosity and openness towards those tools while cultivating an empowered set of values, discernment and boundaries for the experience.

### The Importance of Self care

As you are walking on the path of awakening, some teachings may completely shift your perception of reality and especially the vision you had about yourself. At times, this can feel triggering when what you thought was true about yourself is being deconstructed. It might feel scary, unstable, confusing, unsafe. It is like meeting a stranger. Practice cultivating curiosity, trust and gentleness while diving into the unknown. Something in you choose this path for a reason, a higher guidance is here to serve your blossoming. There is nothing that you are facing that you are not ready for. When you’re feeling more vulnerable, self-care practices can provide you the safe cocoon that you need to integrate what has been learnt or unlearnt and give you a safe ground to keep on in your own time.

### The Role of Integration

Integration is about making conscious the subconscious. It involves bringing awareness to your experiences, processing them, and consciously incorporating the insights, shifts, or learnings into your daily life. Without integration, your experiences, realizations, or learnings remain abstract and isolated incidents. They may feel profound but they may not result in meaningful changes or growth in your daily life. Integration allows you to bridge the gap between your experiential realizations and your lived reality, to strenghten your transformation and growth and make them sustainable. Take as much time as needed to pause, to contemplate, to love yourself every day a little bit deeper.

### Journaling

Journaling can serve as a potent means for your integration process. We invite you to take notes on the teachings and any transmission, insight and breakthrough you are receiving. 

When you journal, you create a space to dialogue with your inner self, to explore, question, express, and clarify your experiences, feelings, and insights.It allows you to record and track your journey, which can offer you a clearer perspective on your growth, emotions and recurring patterns. 

Allow yourself regular times of solitude, silence and contemplation to observe and journal what is awakening or transforming in you. In writing down your experiences and reflections, you facilitate the transition of your internal shifts to your conscious awareness and encourage a deeper grounding of your insights in your life.

### Commitment and devotion

Your journey towards personal (r)evolution is marked by a series of profound shifts and changes that call for your utmost commitment and devotion. How much consistency and dedication can you bring to your self-growth journey? The process of healing can become a fascinating game if you put your heart into it and bring curiosity and gratitude in the face of challenges.

It takes discipline to contemplate and dissolve each and every of your resistances and fully embrace the process. Change occurs not through sporadic engagement but persistent work of witnessing any emotion, any sensation, any reaction, tracing their root, allowing, accepting, embracing.

This discipline and commitment should not from harshness and self-punishment but through devotion and sacredness. Remain kind and patient with yourself. Trees take time to grow roots and grow leafs and fruits that will reach the sky.

This journey is unique to every individual and cannot be rushed or forced. Instead, it's about cultivating a supportive and loving relationship with yourself, meeting yourself where you are each day, and honoring your personal rhythm.

Devotion is approaching the process with a profound gratitude, compassion and respect for your journey and the practices that facilitate it. It is fueled by an intrinsic motivation and deep-seated love for the path you have chosen. Devotion can transform your practices from being mere activities to sacred rituals, thereby infusing them with more meaning and joy.

Commit wholeheartedly, devote yourself trustfully, and allow the magic of self-(revolution to unfold in its own beautiful, natural timing.

### Embodiment practices

As you navigate your transformative journey, be sure to incorporate embodiment practices into your routine such as yoga, meditation, breathwork, singing, dancing or any form of movement or self-expression. Regularly engaging with these practices can support you in anchoring your insights and emotions into your physical body. The insights and knowledge you'll encounter along this journey can lead to profound internal shifts. However, without grounding these shifts within the physical body, they may remain as purely mental or emotional experiences. The act of embodiment allows these shifts to permeate your entire being, enabling you to live and embody these transformations in your daily life.

### Opened communication

You are invited to communicate on your physical and emotional states all along the training. We are available to answer any question, offer exploration paths and guidance, as well as provide you with the necessary support in your process. We are also open for suggestions and comments on anything that could be improve in the training. Please feel free to talk to us anytime, within the group or individually. 

## Glossary of the foundational teachings (A-Z)

### Belief

A belief is a cognitive construct held as true by an individual or a group that form the foundation of our understanding and interpretation of reality.

They are crucial components of our cognitive structure, influencing our thoughts, feelings, and actions. They shape our perception and experience of the world, dictating how we respond to different situations, interpret experiences, and engage with others. They can both empower and limit us, depending on their nature.

Like conditioning, beliefs can be influenced by a variety of factors, including cultural, social, and familial backgrounds, personal experiences, and inherent dispositions. It is important to note that beliefs are malleable, and with self-awareness, reflection, and intention, they can be examined, reevaluated, and transformed to better serve our growth and well-being.

### Collective trauma

Collective trauma refers to psychological distress experienced by a group of people who share a common identity or experience. This can occur as a result of large-scale traumatic events that affect a whole community, society, or even an entire generation or civilization.
Such events can include war, genocide, slavery, displacement, natural disasters, pandemics, or systemic oppression. The shared experience of this trauma can have lasting effects across generations and deeply influence the collective identity, cultural narratives, and societal structures of the affected group.
Just as individual trauma can be healed, so too can collective trauma. This often requires communal efforts towards recognition, dialogue, understanding, and systemic change. 

### Conditioning

Conditioning underscores the influential power of an individual's past experiences, cultural background, societal influences, and family upbringing on their personal development, personnality and behavior, on the way they relate to others and to the world
**Past Experiences and Personal Narrative:** The experiences we have accumulated throughout our life leave an imprint on us. They shape our reactions, behaviors, attitudes, and even our interests. For instance, someone who has faced numerous hardships may develop a high level of resilience.

**Familial Background:** The environment in which we grow up plays a crucial role in shaping our personality. Our familial background, including parenting styles, the family's belief system, and dynamics, conditions our behavior, and sets up the basic foundation for how we relate to others.
**Cultural Influence:** Our cultural background heavily influences our values, beliefs, and attitudes. Every culture has its unique norms, traditions, and customs, which condition its members to think and behave and see the world in certain ways. 
**Social Conditioning:** Societal norms and expectations condition us to behave in ways that are considered acceptable or fitting with the morality or ideal in our society. This can include conditioning related to gender roles, socio-economic behavior, professional roles, and so on. These norms influence our behavior, aspirations, and our interactions with others.

Over time, the repeated patterns of conditioning crystallize into an individual's personality, dictating how they respond to different situations, how they perceive and interact with the world, and even the way they see themselves. However, it's also essential to remember that conditioning can be unlearned. With refined self-awareness, you can change identify the conditioning patterns that create harm and pave the way for personal growth and transformation.

### Conscious, Subconscious, Superconscious

**Conscious mind**

The conscious mind refers to the level of the mind that encompasses thoughts, perceptions, and experiences of which we are actively aware. It functions as the thinking center in our everyday awareness, allowing us to interact with the external world through logic, reasoning, decision-making, and immediate sensory processing.

Our conscious mind helps us perceive our surroundings, interpret information, solve problems, and form thoughts and ideas. 

Although the conscious mind makes up only a small portion of our total consciousness, its influence is powerful. By directing our conscious attention, we can choose our actions, influence our beliefs, and shape our reality.

**Subconscious**

The subconscious, or unconscious mind refers to the part of our mind that operates below the level of conscious awareness. It stores memories, experiences, beliefs, and accumulated knowledge from past events and learned behaviors.
The subconscious mind significantly influences our habits, feelings, reactions, and automatic responses. It's often responsible for spontaneous thoughts, dreams, and sudden insights, surfacing information that we might not have immediate access to in our conscious mind.
Shadow work, therapy, hypnosis and other holistic practices aim to access the subconscious mind to unearth and bring to the light of awareness and transform hidden patterns and deeply embedded beliefs. 

**Superconscious**

The superconscious mind refers to the aspect of consciousness that transcends the individual self, connecting us with higher states of awareness or a greater collective consciousness.
The superconscious mind holds infinite wisdom, inspiration, spiritual insights, revelations and universal truths. It's often associated with experiences of hightened intuition, inspiration, imagination and creative processes, psychic abilities, spiritual awakening, and transcendent states achieved through practices like meditation, prayer, or profound contemplative states.
By tapping into the superconscious mind, individuals may access profound insights and knowingness, and a sense of interconnectedness with the whole world. It is a central concept in many spiritual traditions and practices aimed at self-transcendence and self-realization.

### Coping mechanisms

Coping mechanisms are the strategies that individuals use to manage and adapt to stressful situations, emotional discomfort, or psychological distress. 

Some examples of coping mechanisms are: substance abuse, addiction to social medias, tv and series, food compulsion, nail biting, sex, proscratination, self-isolation…

The coping mechanisms serve us are tools we use to protect from feeling the full spectrum of our emotions that a challenging situation or trauma can trigger. Where they seem to support us in the moment to soothe and navigate the situation, they can actually be harmful, leading to avoidance patterns, denial, or exacerbation of the issue at hand.

Bringing light on our most common coping mechanisms is an essential part of the healing process as the healing resides in allowing ourselves to fully feel.

### Development phases of a child

The developmental stages of a child can be broadly divided into six stages:

1. **Infancy (0-2 years):** This is a period of rapid physical growth and motor development. Infants learn to interact with their environment through sensory exploration and developing basic motor skills like crawling and walking. They form attachments to primary caregivers and start to develop basic communication skills. They learn to trust when caregivers provide reliable care, fostering a sense of safety and security.
2. **Early Childhood/Toddlerhood (2-3 years):** As toddlers, children start developing autonomy. They explore their surroundings more actively, start speaking in complete sentences, and show early signs of independence. They also begin to understand the concept of self and other. They start to engage in symbolic play and learn to manipulate symbols (like language), paving the way for basic social interaction. However, their understanding of the world is still largely influenced by their own perspectives, an attribute the renowned psychologist Jean Piaget called “egocentrism”.
    
    *Needs to be met / Unmet needs: Autonomy vs. Shame/Doubt*
    
    Toddlers are exploring their environment, so their safety needs include close supervision to prevent harm from physical risks. They also need emotional safety through consistent responses to their needs and boundaries to help them understand what's safe and acceptable behavior.
    
3. **Preschool Age (4-5 years):** At this stage, children start developing more complex motor skills and cognitive abilities. Their language use becomes more sophisticated, and they begin to understand abstract concepts. There's also a development of imagination and creative play.
4. **Early School Age (6-8 years):** Children at this stage are more adept at logical thought and start understanding cause-and-effect relationships. Their social interactions become more complex, with the ability to understand others' perspectives and feelings. They start to learn academic skills at school and begin to understand societal rules and expectations.
5. **Middle Childhood (9-11 years):** During middle childhood, children continue to refine their cognitive, social, and motor skills. They start to form stronger peer relationships, develop a sense of self-esteem, and begin to understand more complex academic concepts. This stage often involves more formal learning and may bring with it the pressures of academic performance.
6. **Adolescence (12-18 years):** Adolescents experience significant physical, emotional, and cognitive changes. They develop more abstract thinking abilities, face challenges around their body image and identity, and strive for independence and autonomy. Peer relationships and social acceptance often become paramount, and they begin to grapple with more complex moral and ethical issues.

Erik Erikson's stages of psychosocial development that bring clarity on the child’s needs and the possible consequences of trauma:

1. **Trust vs. Mistrust (0-1 year):** In this stage, infants depend entirely on caregivers. They need their basic needs met consistently - including feeding, changing, sleep, and warmth. If their needs are consistently met, they develop a sense of trust, safet and security in their world. If not, they may develop mistrust, uncertainty, and anxiety.
2. **Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt (1-3 years):** During this stage, toddlers are exploring their environment and start to assert their independence. They also need emotional safety through consistent responses to their needs and boundaries to help them understand what's safe and acceptable behavior. Success leads to feelings of autonomy, failure results in feelings of shame and doubt.
3. **Initiative vs. Guilt (3-5 years):** Preschool children start to assert control and leadership over their environment. Successful experiences foster initiative and a feeling of purpose, while failure or harsh criticism may result in feelings of guilt.
4. **Industry vs. Inferiority (6-11 years):** As children start attending school, learning to read,  write, and do things on their own, safety in a new environment becomes crucial. They need to feel safe in the school setting and in relationships with teachers and peers. Clear rules, understanding of acceptable behaviors, and support in navigating social interactions and more complexe emotions contribute to their sense of safety. Children who are encouraged in that process develop feelings of competence and belief in their skills, those who receive little or no encouragement feel inadequate, unproductive, and may doubt their abilities.
5. **Identity vs. Role Confusion (12-18 years):** Adolescents search for a sense of self and personal identity. They need safe environments in which to explore their burgeoning independence and guidance on how to navigate risks. Emotional safety includes support in navigating self-identity, peer pressure, and more complex social and emotional challenges. Success leads to an ability to stay true to oneself, while failure leads to role confusion and a weak sense of self.

### Diseases

Diseases can be perceived not merely as physical conditions but as manifestations of disruptions in our overall well-being. 

The term "dis-ease" illustrates this view, implying a state of not being at ease or a lack of harmony within oneself. Rather than simply defining diseases as biomedical conditions, this interpretation focuses on a person's overall sense of wellness or balance.

From this perspective, chronic diseases might be seen not as permanent conditions, but as persistent signals of ongoing imbalance within an individual's life.

### Ego

The ego, as a psychological concept, refers to the aspect of an individual's identity that mediates their relations with the external world and their inner experiences. Originating from Freudian psychoanalysis, the ego functions as the conscious rational part of the mind, constructed through conditioning, beliefs, memories, and experiences. This ego-based identity can often lead to a sense of separateness and self-centeredness. 

This is the reason why in many spiritual traditions and therapeutic practices, the concept of ego is explored as a barrier to self-realization and enlightement as it can manifest as a false sense of self and biaised vision of reality. 

### Emotions, Feelings, Perceptions, Interpretations

When it comes to emotions, feelings, perceptions, and interpretations, it's essential to establish the difference among them for a more accurate understanding of our internal states and responses.
Emotions and feelings - like joy, anger, sadness, fear, disgust and surprise - are raw, immediate responses to stimuli. They are valid and true in their nature. 
On the other hand, statements like "I feel abandoned", "I feel rejected", or “I feel unsafe” are not feelings in the truest sense; they are perceptions or interpretations. 

Perceptions and interpretations are our unique translations of the world based on our conditionning and beliefs, our ersonalized narratives about what we think is happening, which may not necessarily align with objective reality.

That doesn't make them untrue or unvalid to us but it means that they arise from our own self-construct, shaped by our personal histories, experiences, traumas, and thinking patterns.
Those perceptions and interpretations form our personal realities as we see the world through the lens of our past, especially events from our early childhood and teenager time. 

Recognizing them as such is empowering because unlike feelings that simply 'are,' we can act upon our perceptions and make them evolve over time.

### Genetic Imprints

Genetic imprints, also known as genetic or epigenetic markers, refer to changes in gene activity that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. These changes can influence an individual's physical characteristics, health conditions, behaviors, and susceptibilities to various conditions or diseases.

Genetic imprinting plays a critical role in development and growth, influencing how genes are expressed or deactivated. Imprints can be inherited from parents and, in certain circumstances, can be influenced by environmental factors or life experiences.

Recent research in the field of epigenetics has suggested that certain experiences, behaviors, or environmental influences can cause changes in gene expression that can potentially be passed down through generations. This understanding provides a biological basis for the intergenerational transmission of traits, behaviors, and potential vulnerabilities or susceptibilities.

It's important to note that genetic imprints don't change the DNA sequence itself but regulate gene activity through mechanisms like DNA methylation and histone modification. Understanding and studying these mechanisms can provide valuable insights into human development, health, and disease, as well as the complex interplay between genetics and environment.

### Inner Child

The concept of the inner child is a powerful metaphor used in psychology and various therapeutic models referring to an aspect of your psyche that retains the experiences, emotions, and memories of your childhood.

The inner child can be visualized as a younger version of yourself, symbolizing your childlike innocence, joy, curiosity, and creativity. It also carries any emotional trauma, unresolved issues, fears, or neglect experienced during your childhood years.

When your needs as a child were not adequately met during your developmental years, it can result as trauma, emotional blockages, self-limiting beliefs, unhealthy behaviors, or difficulties to relate with others and with the world in your adult life.

Working with your inner child - often termed as 'inner child healing' or 'inner child work' - involves reconnecting with this aspect of yourself, acknowledging past pain or neglect, and offering self-understanding, acceptance, and love. It is like holding and loving yourself as you would have needed to be held and loved as a child. This process can bring about profound healing, supporting you in releasing old wounds and traumas, cultivate self-love, reclaim your innate childlike qualities and build a healthier relationship with yourself.

### Intergenerational trauma

Intergenerational trauma, also known as multigenerational trauma, refers to the transmission of trauma and its effects from one generation to the next. It encompasses the collective trauma experienced by a group or a community and its subsequent impacts on later generations. 

Individuals who experienced traumatic events can carry the emotional and psychological burdens of these experiences. This transmission can occur through various mechanisms including learned behaviors, environmental influences, and even potential epigenetic changes.

Acknowledging and addressing intergenerational trauma is crucial for healing and breaking the cycle of transmitted trauma. Therapeutic practices such as family therapy, family constellations, trauma-informed care, and other healing practices can support this process. 

### Interpretations

See the “Feelings, Perceptions, Interpretations” section

### Limitations

Limitations are perceived or actual constraints that restrict our abilities or potentials in some way. They can exist in various forms - physical, mental, emotional, or circumstantial - and can impact various aspects of life, including personal growth, achievements, and overall wellbeing.

Limitations can arise from external sources such as societal norms, environmental factors, or available resources. They can also come from within ourselves, stemming from our mindset, beliefs, self-esteem, and past experiences.

Self-imposed limitations are often based on our conditioned beliefs about ourselves and our capabilities. These can form a restrictive narrative about what we can or cannot achieve. Over time, we may unconsciously adopt these as truths.

### Multigenerational trauma

See the “Intergenerational trauma” section

### Opinions

See the “Points of view and opinions” section

### Pattern

A pattern, in the context of personal growth and psychology, is a repeated or consistent way of thinking, feeling, behaving, or interacting, that we often unconsciously adopt over time. These patterns are generally formed and reinforced through our experiences, beliefs, and the environment in which we grow up.

Recognizing our patterns is the first step towards conscious change. It involves observing our thoughts, behaviors, and emotional reactions. By identifying the underlying beliefs or experiences that drive these patterns, we can begin to understand and address them more effectively. The aim is not to eliminate all patterns but to nurture those that serve us and transform those that hinder our growth and well-being.

### Perceptions

See the “Feelings, Perceptions, Interpretations” section

### Personnality

Personality refers to the distinctive set of characteristics, traits, behaviors, and patterns of thought that define an individual. It shapes how we perceive, interact with, and respond to the world around us.

However, our personality is not entirely fixed. While we develop a solidified sense of self over time, this self-image can be limiting. It can create a narrow frame of who we think we are, constraining our ability to fully embrace and express our inherent potential or authentic self.

When we become overly attached to our conditioned personality, we might overlook or suppress aspects of ourselves that don’t align with this self-perception or with the familial and societal expectations.

The journey of personal growth often involves loosening these solidified aspects of the self and exploring aspects of ourselves beyond them. This may involve challenging our conditioned responses, expanding our self-awareness, and exploring our untapped potential. Through this process, we can slowly detach from who we thought we are and move closer to becoming who we truly are.

### Points of view and opinions

Points of view and opinions can be seen as unique perspectives or interpretations we form based on our individual experiences, beliefs, and values - essentially, they are points of "YOU". These personal outlooks are a significant part of how we understand and interact with the world around us.

Often, these viewpoints can be influenced by our 'judge-mental' capacities, where our ego-mind evaluates, categorizes, and often places labels such as right/wrong or good/bad. While this is a natural part of human cognition, it can sometimes limit our openness to other perspectives or prevent us from seeing the full spectrum of situations or individuals.

The solidification of these viewpoints and opinions often contribute to the formation of our personality - the stable traits and patterns of behavior that characterize us as individuals.

Personal growth and transformation involve inviting change and embracing fluidity in these viewpoints, opinions, or solidified parts of our personality. This doesn't mean abandoning our values or perspectives but being willing to continually learn, evolve, and see the world from a non-dual perspective.

### Shadow work

Shadow work is a psychological and spiritual practice aimed at bringing one's unconscious or disowned aspects - the 'shadow self' - into conscious awareness. This process involves recognizing, accepting, and integrating these hidden parts of ourselves that we might usually  deny or suppress.

The concept of the 'shadow' was introduced by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung and refers to the parts of ourselves that we may deem as shameful, undesirable or unacceptable, often because they do not align with our perceived self-image or familial and societal expectations. These could include suppressed emotions, fears, desires, or past experiences that we find difficult to face.

Shadow work encourages self-exploration to bring light on these facets. This practice might involve self-inquiry, contemplation, meditation, dream analysis, therapeutic practices, or various other self-awareness practices. The goal is not to eliminate the shadow, but to transform our relationship with it, fostering self-acceptance, compassion, and wholeness.

It is a journey of healing, self-discovery, and empowerment, enabling us to embrace our full selves, both the light and the shadow.

### Subconscious

See the “Conscious, Subconscious, Superconscious” section

### Trauma

Trauma can be seen as a profound emotional and internal alterations that arise, not simply from the situations we have experienced, but from our internal responses and emotional upheavals they trigger within us. 

This definition urges us to see trauma as a deeply internal and personal experience, marked not by the external event itself, but by the enduring internal wound it leaves behind. The wound from trauma often warps our perception of the world, leading us to engage with our environment from a restricted and biased perspective.

The repercussions of trauma can vary significantly from person to person, given that each individual's response to a traumatic event is unique and heavily influenced by their personal context. What might seem a minor incident to one person may result in significant trauma for another.
Thus, it is essential to understand there's no hierarchy in trauma: physical and mental abuse can cause trauma, abandonment, rejection, shame, growing with parents with addiction can cause trauma, as well as not being picked up when you cried as a child, not receiving the attention and the love you needed, feeling alone, not seen, not heard, feeling unsafe…

Understanding trauma requires a comprehension of child development phases (see the corresponding section). Childhood is a vulnerable phase marked by crucial physical, emotional, and psychological development. When trauma occurs during these developmental phases, it can have profound impacts on the child's growth, potentially carrying into adulthood.

### Triggers

A trigger is a reminder or catalyst of past traumas or wound. Triggers can come in various forms such as words, events, people, or situations that resonate or recall past experiences, often leading to strong emotional responses in the present.

When we are dealing with unresolved trauma, the past brings a limited perspective to the present. Thus, any upset that we feel in the present is never about the present. It is a resonance of a past situation.

As the author and spiritual teacher A. H. Almaas says, "Your conflicts, all the difficult things, the problematic situations in your life are not chance or haphazard, they are actually yours. They are specifically yours, designed specifically for you by a part of you that loves you more than anything else. That part of you that loves you more than anything else has created roadblocks to lead you to yourself. So then consider that every time you get upset by "somebody or something" it is a part of you that guided you there, because there is something you need to learn. That part of you loves you so much that it doesn't want you to lose the chance. It will go to extreme measures to wake you up. It will make you suffer greatly if you don’t listen.
What else can it do? That is it’s purpose.”

This perspective encourages us to see every trigger or conflict not as a random incident but as potentially orchestrated by a part of us that aims to guide us towards healing. 

Under this interpretation, whenever we feel upset by someone or something, we can consider it as an invitation to delve deeper, to identify the roots of our reaction, and to discover what we need to learn or heal from the situation. All our struggles can actually become valuable opportunities for self-discovery and personal transformation.

## Inspiring transmissions

### Embracing Wholeness: Nothing Needs to be Rejected

That part of yourself, that shadow, is saying you something. How do you feel that part who is in pain would reject if you want to reject it? This pain needs be held, with love, care, compassion

### Reclaiming and letting go

You can’t let go of something you haven’t owned

Ex: If you let go of your attachments to your body

First you have to experience it, otherwise it’s spiritual bypass

Ram Das “before becoming a nobody you have to become a somebody”

### You are love itself

You are wanted by life itself

You were chosen by life

You don't need to seek love outside of you, you are that love

The real trauma is not having not received the love from your parents but having lost the connection with your true essence, to yourself

You are always wanted by life because life wants itself

There is love in this universe that just wants life

### Truth is freedom

What makes us suffer is not living in our truth, the truth of our nature

When we are truth, we are liberated

But knowing the truth on an intellectual level is not enough, we have to experience the truth of ourselves within ourselves, we have to integrate and embody it

That's also why psychedelics are powerful, because it's not only an insight, it's an experience

### Freedom

True Freedom is the absence of suffering

We can free Freedom

Trauma = comfort zone because this is what we know versus freedom of suffering that feels threatening

### Your true nature

Unshakable, invincible

The core essence

Spirit versus Soul

### Non-duality

Life isn’t binary

Right and wrong

Good and bad

= old paradigm

Polarization is from the mind

### Human Self vs Spiritual Self

### The Witness Consciousness

### Everything is temporary

The nature of reality itself is movement and change

### Time is not linear

Quantum physics —> so healing of the past is possible

### The Healing Power of Forgiveness

## Artistry of the Therapist

### The **Qualities of the therapist**

- **Presence**:

Presence has to do with your capacity to be a 100% present with what is happening in the space with your client. To be be present to the other is to know how to be present to yourself and to master your mind instead of being a victim of it.

Anywhere where you can not handle your client’s pain.
Anywhere where you are triggered by your client.
Anywhere where you are frustrated about your client’s process and pace.

Anywhere where you dissociate as an escaping mechanism.
Any glimpse of lack of presence will be felt in the space. Any lack of presence is a preventing the next step of healing and transformation.
Worst case: your client will receive your lack of presence as rejection reproducing their trauma of having a parent that was absent or was there but could not receive and listen to them fully, give them the attention they would have needed

Presence requires the highest level of attunement with yourself, observing what you are going through as your client is sharing, recognising the triggers and places of resonance with your own story, the projections you might be doing onto your client, the places where you still have to heal and transmute

For example, if you're comfortable with your own pain, you'll not be comfortable with your client's pain.

If you cannot handle anger for example, you'll be triggered by a client who expresses anger.

If your client is caught in a loop of victimhood that reminds you your mother and how you suffered from her pattern, you’ll be triggered by them

In the highest state of presence, you could become an instantaneous channel for healing, without having to do or say anything. Your client would heal by the very fact of being witness in such high unshakable state of presence, full presence that they often lacked as a child and unconsciously associated with not being fully loved or worthy. 

This quality of presence connects to:

- **Transparency**:

The word *transparent* comes from Latin transparere from *trans-* ‘through’ + *parere* ‘appear’ and later on from medieval Latin *transparent -* ‘shining through’

Being transparent is litteraly letting things appear, bringing light to shine through what needs to be seen.

The more transparent you are, the more it leaves space for your client to look at themselves.

You are becoming a mirror of truth.

You can't see your face without a mirror. Relationships act as a mirror. Therapy act as a mirror.

If you're going to be the mirror for your client, your duty is to clean all the incrustrations and blurriness of your own glass.

If everyone in the world could be transparent, our own essence would unveil so clearly that we would instantaneously become it. It would be an immediate awakening. 

As a last point, note the fascinating power of hidden sounds in the word *transparent* where you can hear *trans-parent* - beyond the parent.

- **Compassion and open heart**

As a therapist, you should be able to express deep empathy and understanding towards your clients’ struggles, this kind of empathetic connection that comes from a place of genuine concern, open heart and shared feeling. It encourages your client to openly share their experiences, fostering a healing environment of acceptance and understanding.

Becoming a therapist or practitioner must come from a genuine yearning to be in service of humanity, to receive other human beings with your heart wild open and through their transformation bring change into the world.

This compassionate approache goes in pair with:

- **Curiosity**:

Replacing judgement or blaming with curiosity can be a game changer in therapy sessions. Curiosity helps maintain an open-minded approach, viewing your clients' experiences as fascinating journeys of self-discovery, becoming more and more curious about the nature of humankind. By asking insightful questions out of genuine interest, you can guide your clients to explore their feelings, thoughts, and behaviours in new and empowering ways.

- **Authenticity**

Authenticity is about staying true to your integrity, and personal values and being genuine in your interactions with your client. It is also about showing your clients that, like them, you have your strengths and weaknesses, and have had your fair share of life experiences. You are not this God that knows it all; you are also human, you went through some of the situations and emotions they went through, they can identify to you and see their own potential of growth. You can chose to share some of you personal stories and challenging and how you dealt with them when it is in service of their healing. Aknowledging what you went through in your own healing process can support them in believing in their own healing and your vulnerability and authenticity can enhance your bond with your client and instil trust.

- **Confidence**

Being confident is showing to your clients that they are in safe, competent hands. It reassures them that they are being held and supported as they navigate their healing journey. 

Work on clearing any area where you might lack confidence in holding them, where you might feel you are not legitimate enough, not trained enough, any “imposter’s syndrom” to become a stable loving ground for your clients. 

- **Intuition, guidance**

When attuned to presence, your intuition and guidance naturally give you some keys of what is going on for the client. You can tap into your intuitive sense or psychic abilities to understand the client's situation at a deeper level. Notice any shift in their energy, any gut feeling, any sensation in your body telling you something about the situation, allow the receiving of clear images, clear knowingness, clear sounds or messages that offer guidance. This doesn't mean that you will predict, control the therapy or trying for your client to “get somewhere , but that you can allow your intuitive insights to support and guide your work. 

### The Skills **of the therapist**

- **Building attunement**

The attunement is your capacity to enter in direct and subtle connection with your client and align your energy with them. It is about being so present - with your breath, with your body, with the verbal and non-verbal communication - that you are becoming a clear empathetic channel for your client. The more you refine your attunement, the more you have the capacity to sense the emotional landscape of the client. The highest state of attunement has to do with psychic abilities such as clairsentience (feeling beyond matter), clairaudience (hearing beyond matter), clairvoyance (seeing beyond matter) and clear chanelling (receiving clear knowing). When those abilities are activated, you are able to feel what your client is feeling in their own body, to receive visions, sounds and wisdom from the quantum field of consciousness that will support and serve your client.

One of the ways to enter in attunement with your client is to open your session by a short meditation to connect to one another. You can guide them into becoming aware of their body, of their breath, synchronise each other’s breath and taking the time to be present together, in the same space. 

- **Creating safety and supporting client’s sovereignty**:

Safety is an essential prerequisite in the healing process. The safest your client is feeling, the more they will be willing to open up, dig deeper in their own story and trauma and see what has been buried and that is not always comfortable to see.

When your client is revisiting a traumatic experience or memory in a safe container, this is where the healing can happen. All the previously described qualities - your capacity to be attuned and present, to actively listen, your tone of voice and body language, your curiousity, compassion… - are participating in creating a safe and reassuring space for your client. 

Another way to maintain safety in a therapy session is to give priority to the client's readiness to engage. For instance, at the very begining of a session, after opening with a short meditation or attunement, you could ask to your client “Are you feeling ready to start?”. In the same way, during the session, when you are touching a sensitive point of your client’s story, when a trauma or a memory is uncovered, when a huge breakthrough has occured, you could ask to your client “Are you feeling okay/ready to continue?”.

Creating safety in a session is intimately related with the client’s sovereignty. This permission to continue is a way to create safety and trust between you and your client but also to remind them that they hold power over the session's direction and pace and they have the right to stop or pause at any point.
Similarly, practicing consent when offering any body therapy or energetic healing keeps your client empowered in their choices. In the case of therapy in contact with the body, some of your clients might have faced physical and/or sexual abuse and it is essential to keep that awareness and ask for consent whenever you are going to physically interact with them, remembering that we don't work on the client, we work with the client. Sentences like "At any moment if anything feels uncomfortable, please express it", "What would you need right now?", "is there anything you would you like to get, release or welcome from our session" can support reinforcing the clients’ sovereignty. 

Ultimately your intuition will guide you in the knowingness of what can be done or not done and safety and sovereignty can be created through non-verbal communication as well but I would highly encourage you to experiment with those sentences especially when you are just starting sessions with a new client.

- **Refining your tone of voice and body language**

In therapy, there is all the wisdom you are going to share with your clients but also as important (and sometimes more) all subtle cues of non-verbal communication, tone of voice and body language. You can learn to refine your tone in order to communicate with patience, compassion and empathy, providing an auditory signal that you are fully present and engaged. Sometimes, a certain degree of firmness in what you share can also have an empowerment effect for your client, giving them confidence and strenght to approach their own process. Similarly, body language - such as open and relaxed posture, an attentive eye contact or at times closed-eyes of presence, connection and channeling - sends nonverbal messages of receiving, care, and validation.

- **Creating space**:

As a therapist we don’t give space or hold space - space was never ours in the first place so we have no power in giving or holding it. Rather consider the idea of creating space. Creation has an alive, organic quality attributed to the space. Creating space in your sessions is allowing your client’s own wisdom to be channeled through. When in the middle of a conversation, create enought pauses for them to receive their own answers. After they have finished their last sentence, wait a few minutes in silence before asking the next question and same if don’t talk if they have their eyes closed and are diving within or  looking on the side; wait for them to come back to eye contact before talking. Remember that your client is intelligent and aware enough to receive all their answers. Only their trauma shut down their awareness at time because it was too painful for them to stay aware. If you create enough space, they will receive their own insights and breakthroughs in their own timing and it has much more effect on the healing process than if you were giving all the answers yourself and that they are not always ready to be received, accepted and integrated.

- **Supporting responsability**

As a therapist, part of your role is to support your clients in taking responsibility for what is happening in their own life. This involves gently guiding them away from blaming others or themselves and towards owning their feelings, owning their choices, and experiences. Ultimately, they would be able to see through their own implication and responsability in any trauma or situation that they faced and understand the cocreative game of consciousness where they consciously or unconsciously manifest their reality in order to learn, grow and expand at a soul level. 

As long as they are still seeing themselves as the passive victim, blaming others for what happened, they can not act upon what happened to them and the suffering remains.  

The whole dance of the therapist is approaching their client with enough compassion and understanding, validating their emotion and their experience while still contributing for them to move forward and take responsability.

By empowering them to shift from a state of victimhood to becoming responsible - 

*response-able -* beings, they learn to harness their innate power to navigate challenges and facilitate their own healing.

- **Growing Trust in your client’s healing process**

Anything that is solidified is more complicated to change. You can see it like this: a table - that is the sum of a multitude of microparticules so solified that they become matter - is much harder to break or shape than a current of water that is fluid and flowing. This allegory can support the comprehension of the healing process. Anything that you solify makes it harder to change. And in the same way, everywhere where you see fluidity you open the possibility for change. This connects to the principle of Quantum Physics and how the observer’s eye is changing the result of an experiment.
Applying those principles to your role as a therapist: having trust in your client’s healing process is essential. When you trust their ability to change you in turn inspire them to believe in their own healing and transformation and as they believe so, they have the capacity to manifest it quicker and more efficiently.

Be aware everywhere you witness thoughts in you such as “they will never change”, “they are stuck in the same loop”, “they always come up with the same story”, “their trauma has done too much harm”, “it’s too late for them”.

Everywhere where you give up on your client’s possibility for healing, or expect them to get somewhere, or go faster in their healing process, you are becoming the traumatic figure they most probably had in their life that saw them as failures or expect them to be a certain way, other than who they truly where. 

Remember to let go of any attachment to outcomes. Each client's transformational journey is unique and unruly in its own way, and the pace of progress may vary. It's not a reflection of your efficacy as a therapist but an indication of the diverse and complex nature of human experience. Instead, allow each client to navigate their journey in their own time, embracing their progress, however incremental it may be, with understanding and appreciation.
See them for their possibilities, for their victories, for their true essence and spirit rather than for their limitations. Respect their divine pace and remain opened to be surprised. 

### **Awareness of the therapist**

- **Projections**

When you’re interacting with your clients, it's critical to be aware of the dynamic of projection. Projections can be understood as unconscious transference of our own traumas, feelings, fears, or expectations onto others. As a therapist, your own projections might colour your perception of a client, potentially leading to perceptions, interpretations and judgements. Be aware of everywhere your client’s story reminds you of yours, everywhere where your client reminds you of one of your parent or close relative (see the *recognising the triggers* section below).

Equally, your clients might project their own expectations or emotions or even a paternal figure or romantic partner onto you. This can present a challenge but also a therapeutic opportunity, as recognizing and working through these projections can lead to profound insights and personal growth for both you and your client.

- **Don't try to fix or give advice**

As therapists, it's natural to feel a desire to help and heal, to transform the lives of your clients. 

Sat Dharam, worldwide renown teacher and founder of the “Beyond Addiction” program says: "It is really important that we let go that our job is to transform them. It’s not to transform them. We let go that our job is to save them. We are not here to save them. Our job is to present them with the possibility of transformation. Whether they take that possibility or not, it has nothing to do with us succeeding or failing. That’s up to them."

The therapeutic journey isn't about instant fixes or clear-cut advice from the therapist to the client. Rather, it is a unique process of guided self-discovery for each individual. It's a path where clients gradually uncover their strengths, address their fears, and navigate their challenges, essentially forging their own solutions. As a therapist, you're not the savior or the magician who makes their struggles disappear. Instead, you're the compassionate companion and insightful guide who supports them as they explore the landscape of their inner world.
Therefore, resist the urge to give direct advice or attempt to fix things for your clients or make them feel better. Instead, create the safe container for them to be present with their emotions and feelings, to face and embrace thm, present them with tools, resources, and opened questions that encourage them to tap into their own wisdom. Guide them gently towards their self-generated solutions and the inherent potential for transformation.
The goal here isn't about leading them to a pre-determined destination, but rather about facilitating a process where they learn to understand themselves better, trust their instincts, and become empowered to make decisions that align with their well-being and growth.

This perspective invites us to hold space for our clients in their own growth process, respecting their autonomy and the uniqueness of their therapeutic journey.

- **Recognising the Triggers**

Navigating personal triggers is a journey of self-awareness for both therapist and client. Understanding your triggers as a therapist is just as primordial as helping your clients understand theirs. Remember that there is no such thing as “a difficult client”. 
When a client's behaviour, words, or story resonates with your own emotional history or brings about a strong reaction within you, it's an indication that a personal trigger has been activated. The challenges you perceive in the therapeutic relationship may often be a reflection of these triggers, casting light on unresolved issues or unexplored territories within your own psyche.
Recognising these triggers is the first crucial step towards maintaining your integrity as a therapist. It creates an opportunity for you to reflect, to delve into your inner world, and explore the root of these reactions. 

Furthermore, these shared experiences or resonant triggers can serve as potent therapeutic tools. They can guide your interventions and allow you to better understanding of your clients. Integrating your own shadows and insights can enrich the therapeutic support you can offer. Sharing with your client that you are experiencing a resonance in their story can also be a way to deepen the authentic bond and the trust with them and making them feel understood and seen.

All the practitioners are also human beings with their own story and their own wounds. The acknowledgment and awareness of your own wound is essential in supporting the therapeutic process.

In theta healing: when you start the session, you can visualise to remove your persona and put it on the shelf. If you feel too triggered about a client, you need to stop working with them.

- **Self-care and Boundaries**

Embarking on a path of service, especially as a therapist, requires deep commitment, devotion, empathy, and a profound understanding of the human condition. As you navigate the intricacies of your clients' inner landscapes, it is crucial to uphold a steadfast commitment to your well-being. Engaging in consistent self-care is not a luxury in this profession - it is a necessity.

One integral aspect of self-care as a therapist is maintaining clear boundaries. You will interact with diverse individuals carrying a wide range of traumas and emotional experiences. While it's crucial to provide a compassionate space for their healing journey, it's equally important to delineate a container of availability for your clients to ensure you retain time for your own rest, rejuvenation, and personal growth. Clearly informing your clients of your availabilities as well as setting up some technologic tools - such as desactivating your notifications at certain hours - can support you in maintening your work-life balance.

Additionally, it's vital to remember that it's not just about setting boundaries with your clients, but also with yourself. As therapists, we often have a high drive to support and sometimes feel the necessity to always be available. We might also experience fears that prevent us to set our boundaries and can sometimes lead to overwork, over-commitment or even burn-out. It is important to observe carefully all your mechanisms regarding the expression of your boundaries, the eventual tendancy to please others, the beliefs that you should always be available, post on social medias, answer messages, all the attachments to keeping your clients bonded to you, the eventual fears of loosing them, of loosing their money, the fear of lack, greed, scarcity mindset, the “nice girl” or “nice boy” syndrome; all of this should be looked at very deeply in order to clear any unhealthy behaviour and maintain the integrity of your work and your well-being. Take some time to pause, to answer your needs, and respect your limits.

Remember the importance of nourishing your own emotional and mental well-being. Engage in activities that replenish your spirit, nurture your inner peace, and promote emotional resilience. This might include meditation, journaling, nature walks, art, or maintaining meaningful personal relationships. You might also find it beneficial to seek your own therapy - a space where you can feel supported, heard and seen.

When you nourish your inner world, you create a safe, healthy, and potent space for your clients to navigate theirs. Your commitment to self-care sets an example for your clients and emphasizes the importance of self-compassion and healthy boundaries in their own lives.

In essence, the practice of self-care and maintaining clear boundaries is about cultivating a therapeutic practice that honors your own humanity.

- **Divine flow**

In time, with practice and dedication, you will learn that exhaustion as a therapist can not really exist. As you cultivate self-love and align yourself with the divine flow of life, a profound shift occurs - you discover a limitless reservoir of energy that was always available to you. This boundless source, saturated with pure love and healing potential, can continually refuel and invigorate you, enabling you to serve others more effectively.

The transformation comes when we comprehend that we do not need to utilize our own energy and drain ourselves to support others. We have access to a much greater power - the Universal Energy, the Divine Source.

The divine flow is a tangible resource you can learn to tap into. This Source, this energy of the Universe, this Love, can be visualized as a powerful river, constantly flowing, inexhaustible, and abundant. When you learn to connect with this divine flow, you essentially transform into a conduit for this potent healing energy. Rather than giving from your own reserves, you become a vessel, channeling the infinite love and energy of the Universe to assist and support those you serve.

The same energy that replenishes and revives your clients also recharges you. The energy doesn't distinguish between the giver and receiver. Instead, it's an organic cycle of giving and receiving, represented by the shape of the Torus that infinitely gives and feeds itself. Thus, every time you extend this energy to serve others, you are, at the same time, receiving and being served by it. This universal energy, as it moves through you to assist your clients, revitalizes you, nourishes your physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being, fuels you with life force and vital energy and uplifts your magnetic field and your whole spirit.

This creates a reciprocal dynamic where serving others becomes an act of self-service too. Every therapy session you conduct, instead of depleting your energy, becomes an opportunity to connect with love and replenish from this divine flow. 

It is also an infinite reservoir of wisdom and intuition, that can support you in sharpening your intuitive capacities, enhancing your understanding of your clients' needs, and guiding the unfolding of your sessions. 

## Toolbox for self-healing

### **Triggers as catalysts for liberation**

You will notice that you tend to manifest situations that precisely pinpoint what needs to be acknowledged and healed within you.

When you are able to see triggers not as something umconfortable that needs to be rejected but as a gift that you have manifested yourself for your own healing, you are able to welcome them with more ease as they serve as revealing indicators of unprocessed emotions, unresolved traumas, or subconscious beliefs. As such, your reactions to triggers can become illuminating tools in your healing journey. 

Observing and understanding these triggers allow us to locate where tension or resistance has built up within your emotional and mental realms. Harnessing your interactions with others as mirrors, you can “use them” as a way to unravel the deepest layers of yourself.

Some questions for contemplations:

- What are my most common responses to triggers? What emotions do these triggers bring in me?
- How does my body physically respond to these triggers, and what could this tell me about my stored emotions or traumas?
- What recurring themes can I identify in the situations that trigger me?
- Can I trace my triggers back to any particular experiences, beliefs, or values from my past?
- How might my reactions to triggers be informing me about parts of myself that are asking for attention or healing?
- Can I identify any defenses or protective mechanisms that I employ in response to these triggers? What might they be safeguarding?
- Where are those spaces within me, those emotions that I find so hard to face and feel that unconsciously manifest triggerings situations, arguments, confrontations in order to build up tension and have the opportunity to release?
- How can I channel my awareness of triggers into positive change and growth?
- How can my relationships with others provide insight into my own triggers, and how can this understanding aid my personal journey?
- What shifts when I choose to view these triggers as opportunities for growth instead of sources of discomfort? With acceptance and curiosity, rather than fear or avoidance?
- How can I cultivate compassion for myself in the face of these triggers?
- What steps can I take to convert the understanding of my triggers into actionable paths towards healing and growth?

### The Clearing process

You can envision the clearing process in several steps:

1- **Aknowledging**: This first step implies becoming aware that it exists a tension, a trauma, a trigger inside me. This awareness is the initial step, recognizing the existence of an inner disturbance and its impact on my emotional state. This journey begins with opening oneself to the truth of one’s state and its need for attention.

2- **Feeling**: I am allowing every emotion to surface, even (and especially) the ones that often come with shame or guilt, such as anger, rage, sadness, confusion. What does it mean to let them exist? It first involves identifyinh when your inner critic judges them preventing you from truly experiencing your feelings. Often, this inner critic may be the representation of an authority figure from our past—parents, teachers, or other family members. You learn that if you feel the way you feel, you will be rejected and not receive the love that you need and start to act according to what people are expecting from you more than what you’re truly feeling and being. You can ask this critic to momentarily step back, for him to wait in the waiting room or be stored in a little box, to provide space for the raw emotion to unfold.
Feeling also means the experience at the body level. Where is this anger felt? What are the sensations, the stuckness, the tensions and constrictions? When anger arises, where do you feel it the most? What is the message behind this sensation, and what does it need from you?  Feel it all, in your bones, in your muscles, in your cells.

3- **Releasing**: Children that grow up in an environment where it feels safe to express are masters at releasing. They cry, rage, throw tantrums, but a moment later, they are back to playing and laughing. They are masters of emotional release and can move on so fast because they are allowing the full release to be without thinking it should or shouldn’t look a certain way. They let their feelings exist and express them without inhibitions, without the shackles of 'right' or 'wrong'. As product of longer conditionning, adults often start to act according to what is socially acceptable, loosing touch with that rawness of expression that children have. Releasing is an essential step in the clearing process. It can look like: crying, screaming, any anger release practice (punching pillows, shaking…), embodiment practices like breathwork, tapping, martial arts, voice liberation, among others.

4- **Reflecting**

Turn inward to examine your thoughts, feelings, and emotions more deeply. What is the tension and why? What triggered you and why? What parts of you are reacting to this? How are past experiences or unmet needs influencing your reactions? This inner exploration helps identify patterns, connect dots and uncover deep-seated beliefs and behaviors. Reflection is often enhanced by practices such as journaling, meditation or seeking perspective from a trusted friend or mentor.

5- **Integrating**

The last step in the clearing process is all about embracing, accepting and incorporating the understanding and growth achieved during the previous steps. It is about creating a new narrative for yourself that includes your expanded awareness and altered responses to emotional triggers. This doesn't mean you become immune to emotions or reactions. Rather, you become more skilled in handling them consciously, and this new level of understanding gets integrated into your life, subtly shifting your outlook and responses. Integration might manifest through behavior changes, affirmation practices, setting new boundaries, or even redefining personal relationships. It's a deeply personal process for you to become a more authentic, aware, and aligned version of yourself. 

Some questions for contemplation:

- What barriers or beliefs prevent me from truly feeling my emotions, and how can I work towards transcending them?
- What physical sensations do I notice in my body when different emotions arise, and what can these sensations tell me?
- In what ways can I actively express and release my emotions in a healthy and supportive way?
- How does releasing my emotions impact my overall wellbeing and emotional state?
- How can I radically commit to the clearing process remind myself of the growth and transformation that it gives when I'm faced with discomfort?
- What methods or practices have I found to be most helpful in assisting my clearing process, and why?
- How can the experiences of my clearing process deepen my empathy and understanding for others' journeys?
- How has the clearing process influenced my overall perception of self, relationships, and the world around me?

**Questions as Openers**: The act of asking thoughtful and open-ended questions can initiate a profound journey of healing. This tool is about exploring the depths of our being by probing the layers of our conscious and subconscious mind. With every question asked, a doorway opens to deeper self-understanding and revelation. The power of a well-placed question is in its potential to challenge assumptions, incite curiosity, and encourage reflection, leading us to connect more deeply with our innermost thoughts, emotions, and experiences. The skill lies in asking questions that don't impose a perspective, but instead, open up a realm of possibilities for us to explore, thereby initiating the healing process.
**Language, Door to the Subconscious**: The language we use, both verbal and non-verbal, is a significant component of our healing toolbox. Every word, tone, or gesture used is a manifestation of our innermost thoughts and feelings and offers a gateway to understanding our subconscious mind. Mirroring language, a method in which you reflect back the language or behavior of another person, can be used as a tool for validation, empathy, and building trust. It can also assist in creating a safe space where feelings are recognized and valued, aiding the healing process. 

**Somatic Work: Engaging with your Body Sensations**: This approach encourages awareness and recognition of the physical sensations within your body. The body often stores stress, trauma, and emotional energy; by bringing attention to these sensations, you allow for the potential to release this stored energy. By grounding ourselves in our physicality, especially when we tend to dwell in the cognitive space, we can form a better connection between our mind, body, and emotions, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of ourselves. Recognizing body sensations and giving them attention can result in tension release and can ultimately help liberate stored emotions and initiate healing.

**Family Constellations**: Family Constellation therapy can significantly contribute to healing by illuminating hidden dynamics within a family system. This therapy considers issues not as individual problems but as generational narratives, believing that many personal challenges, fears, or habits may have roots in the traumas and behavioral patterns of our ancestors. Understanding these dynamics can help in breaking the cycle and can create a newfound sense of liberation and personal empowerment, thereby facilitating deep healing. 

**Healing the Inner Child**: Inner child work focuses on reconnecting with and nurturing the vulnerable child within us. This aspect of our being holds onto early experiences and childhood wounds that may influence our present beliefs, behaviours and emotional health. The inner child reflects our innocence, joy, curiosity, needs and even trauma experienced during our formative years. By addressing the pain, fear or neglect that this part of us may hold onto, we create space for healing, growth and transformation. This process involves validation, comforting and ultimately re-parenting our inner child, thus leading to integration, self-love and profound healing.

**Distinguishing the Speaker Within**: This practice is about becoming aware of the source of our inner voice or voices. Each person carries an internal dialogue that's influenced by different parts of our psyche - heart, mind, intellect, ego, and gut. Each one has its unique way of processing and responding to situations. By tuning into these diverse inner voices, we develop a better understanding of our responses to situations and can work towards nurturing a harmonious relationship between these different aspects of ourselves.

**Parts Work**: In line with recognizing the speakers within, parts work is about identifying and understanding the different 'parts' or aspects of our psyche, such as our inner child, inner critic, inner nurturer, etc. Techniques such as Internal Family Systems therapy (IFS) help in recognising these sub-personalities, understanding their intentions and facilitating their healing. When each 'part' is appreciated and integrated, we can experience enhanced self-understanding, increased internal harmony and personal growth. **February 9, 2024 1:26 PM (GMT+1)**

**Beliefs Work**: Beliefs are powerful forces that shape our reality, behaviors, and identities. They form the foundation of our understanding of ourselves and the world. Sometimes, our beliefs can limit our potential, create self-sabotage or generate unhelpful behaviours. Belief work involves identifying these limiting or dysfunctional beliefs and transforming them. Techniques such as muscle testing and reprogramming, hypnotherapy or cognitive behavioural therapies can help in recognizing and replacing these restrictive beliefs, opening doors to healing, personal expansion and freedom.

**Bridging Timelines**: The process of healing is a journey across time - making peace with our past, living mindfully in our present and cultivating a vision for our future. This approach involves integrating and healing past experiences, traumas, and limiting beliefs that impact our present life. At the same time, it entails visualising, connecting with and embodying our future selves - the individuals we aspire to become. By affirming andembodying our future selves - the individuals we aspire to become. By affirming and integrating all these timelines, we create a coherent and powerful narrative of growth and transformation that catalyses deep healing.

**Compassionate Inquiry**: This is a psychotherapeutic approach developed by Dr. Gabor Maté that involves asking oneself compassionate and introspective questions to explore the root causes of personal suffering. This approach allows us to face our traumas, emotional pain, or self-sabotaging behaviors with empathy and understanding. In doing so, we can begin to comprehend and heal from the pain carried within us, fostering a deeper relationship with ourselves in the process.

**Shadow Work**: Developed from Carl Jung's concept of the "Shadow," this method encourages individuals to confront and integrate their disowned or ignored parts — the aspects of themselves that they have pushed away or denied due to societal norms or personal fear. By embracing and understanding these 'shadows', we can start to heal these wounded aspects of ourselves, leading to a more authentic, integrated self.

**Community & Connection**: The act of sharing, connecting, and healing together as a community can be profoundly therapeutic. Engaging with like-minded individuals provides a sense of belonging and understanding that can significantly aid the healing process. Community provides us with a space for mutual support, encouragement, shared wisdom, and collective growth.

**Tools of Expressions (Arts, Writing, Dance, etc.)**: Artistic and creative outlets such as writing, painting, dance, or music are powerful tools for emotional release and self-exploration. They provide a safe space for the expression of complex emotions, experiences, or traumas that may be challenging to communicate verbally. By allowing for such open expression, these outlets can initiate a process of catharsis, liberation, and healing.

**Releasing Techniques**: These methods are all about letting go of what no longer serves us. This can include trapped emotions, unhelpful thought patterns, limiting beliefs, or physical tension. Various practices like Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), Bio-Emotive Framework, or simple deep-breathing exercises can help us in recognizing and releasing these held-on energies, paving the way for healing. 

Each tool has its unique strength and application, and it's essential to choose and use these tools wisely depending on the individual's unique journey and needs. Always remember that healing is a process, often non-linear, that requires patience, love, and constant support. Please always seek professional help when dealing with deep emotional or psychological issues.
