This blended approach hilights the multifaceted nature of the human experience, understanding that physical, emotional, and energetic aspects are intimately interwoven. Our teachings seek to harmonize these aspects, providing a comprehensive approach to healing and personal growth.

This combination of trauma-informed therapy and energy healing fosters a unique, comprehensive and integrative path to self-discovery, healing, and transformation, equipping participants to thrive in their journey of self and in guiding others on their paths.

### **Who Is It For:**

This training is ideal for those seeking a profound understanding of their true selves and their life story. It is designed for individuals called to dive deep into their own healing journey and those wishing to guide others and become practitioners. If you're a therapist looking to expand your skillset, a spiritual seeker craving transformation, or an individual eager to bring change in yourself and to the world, this training offers you a nurturing space to grow.

### **Training Structure:**

The Integrative Practitioner Training extends over a period of six months, segmented into two parts:

**1. The Inner Ascend Core Training (4-months)**
For the first four months, the focus is on 'Core Training', which serves as a journey inward to self-discovery. This phase is about getting to know oneself, exploring deep-seated wounds, and discovering techniques for self-healing. We'll delve into various methodologies and practices that nurture holistic self-awareness and healing, setting the foundation for the practitioner's journey.

**2. The Inner Ascend Practitioner Training (2 months)**

The subsequent two months concentrate on 'Practitioner Training'. In this phase, you'll leverage the profound understanding of self you've developed, translating it into essential qualities and skills to guide others. It’s about integrating the teaching learned, embodying your growth, and applying it all to support others on their own journeys. 

**Additional notes:**

- In our training structure, we offer flexibility to cater to individual needs and commitments. Participants have the option to join either the full 6-month Core Training + 2-months Practitioner training, or the 4-month Core Training only.
- Additionally, if you choose to undergo the Core Training initially, you also have the option to join a later cohort for the Practitioner Training. This offers flexibility for those who wish to deepen their practice at a later date or want to gain more experience and self-understanding before stepping into the practitioner role. Our primary goal is to ensure you can access this transformative journey in a manner that fits where you are at in your journey.
- Regardless of prior experience, we require all participants to complete the Core Training before progressing to the Practitioner Training. This ensures a solid foundational understanding and personal growth experience, essential for effectively guiding others in their journeys. This is a critical prerequisite that allows the Practitioner Training to fully enhance and leverage your ability to support others in their self-discovery and healing journey.
