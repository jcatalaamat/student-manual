# 4B.29 Male bodies

When you are ready, write in your journals if you are a man:

- Where in your life have you felt this pressure and not even realised it if you felt pressured to be aggressive?
- Where have you felt pressured to control women or have you felt pressure to provide?
    - I felt pressure to provide. By women. They wanted me to buy things, get things, in no expectation of return or being equal.
    - It’s what men do. They are meant to control and dominate a woman.
    - For providing, yeah. Men have to provide money. Only success if money. Is the first and foremost. Even my mum prefers me to have a good job than a fulfilling relationship that follows natural laws. Money and success are the main relevant things in life.
    - And in women I’ve seen this same pressure. Expectations, feeling of not being loved unless you are over them.
- Where have you felt pressured to show contempt for homosexuals? Where have you felt this pressure and how is it affecting your body?
    - I have felt lot of pressure to have to be fine with homosexuals. Like there’s been a battle. I don’t know what I feel about homosexuals. Normally I don’t feel great. Like I have to do things because someone says so. I feel weird about their behaviour, what they play out. Sometimes and specially recently. I feel like they may be playing deep trauma unresolved ancestral trauma and they don’t realise their relationships (as much as polyamory) is a trauma response.
    - It’s making me tense. Like I hate myself. Like I have to contempt others opinions and points of views. Like if I don’t feel like something is fine with how things are in the world I am going to be crossed as homophobic and I am not allowed to own my feelings of feeling off by people’s lives and energy.
- How is it creating the energy of disease within you?
    - I hate, have fear, reject myself. Old lives. Past lives. Holding on to grief, anger, hatred. Feeling overwhelmed, stressed, anxious. Having to show up my worth constantly. Having to prove myself.
