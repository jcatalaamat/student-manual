# 3B.21 The secret language of your body ✅

Write down your fears of listening to what your body has to say.

- If your body has a voice. If you have been ignoring that voice, what are you afraid it is going to tell you?
    - That I am happy. That I can let go of the fear now. That I will be taking care of myself. That I am whole. That nothing ever happened. That I can get over now.
- And if you listen to it, what would you have to change?
    - My relationships to one another. I would listen more. I would be more selfless. I would not have to take care of no one. I would not have to sacrifice any part of me to take care of my needs and wants. I would love myself more.
- And then if you don't listen to your body if you continue to do what you are doing and ignore the fact that it has a voice and that it is an incredibly intelligent consciousness, what is
going to happen in your life? What is the effect of this going to be?
    - I won’t live a happy life. I will die in sorrow, repenting, repeating the same patterns over and over again. Unfulfilled moment of passing.
- What's going to happen if nothing changes and if you keep ignoring your body? What are the consequences?
    - I will get obese. I will eat my brain out. I will burn out. I will stop taking care of my needs. I will stop willing to live.
