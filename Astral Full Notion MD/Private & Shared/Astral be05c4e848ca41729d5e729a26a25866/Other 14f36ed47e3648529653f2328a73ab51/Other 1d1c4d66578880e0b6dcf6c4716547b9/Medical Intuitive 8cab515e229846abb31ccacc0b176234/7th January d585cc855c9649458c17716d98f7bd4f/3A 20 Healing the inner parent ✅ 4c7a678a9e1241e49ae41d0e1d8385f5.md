# 3A.20 Healing the inner parent ✅

- How does your inner parent treat your inner child?
    - Terribly, it criticises every step of the journey. It tells him how bad he is, how long it’s going to take. How he was better off without his own judgement. How he was meant to follow their parents advice in order not to fail in life. How to be completely alone and isolated. And hurt.
- How do you parent yourself?
    - A little bit. I tell myself what options I have to feel better about myself. How to love, listen myself. How to hold myself in compassion.
- How do you deal with yourself when you are being lazy or immature, when you're underperforming or when you're not fulfilling your potential?
    - I am very hard on myself when I feel that the change is going to drastically change me in the future. When something is truly ‘important’ it’s when I become harsher with myself. It connects with making me not drop university when I didn’t want to continue. Not truly letting me or condition me not to pursue other careers that were making me happy (mine didn’t!)
    - I’m normally fine with this. It’s mostly when I am to do something relevant, or something that matters, that my inner parent / critic tells me how bad I am doing. When I am being tested by the universe. When I consider that the lesson is going to impact relevantly my future, my present, when things are a shaping who I am becoming into the future.
- How do you deal with yourself?
    - I hold myself responsible. I blame myself. I hurt myself. I indulge in toxic behaviours. I eat. I hide. I create more problems around me in order to hide the wrongness in me.
- How do you speak to yourself?
    - Harshly, I tell myself I am silly, stupid, I am wrong.
- You're going to get a picture of how your inner parent works and where did you learn that - was it from your mom or dad?
    - My inner parent is flexible until it is not. Then it becomes harsh, when it crosses a ‘virtual’ line, it becomes critic.
    - It tells me how bad I am, how I am not going to make it, how I shouldn’t try.
    - I learnt it from my mum, she was busy, hysterical, neurotic, wanted to get things done now, she would not be taken care by the universe. In fact, God abandoned her. God was punishing. All was horrible. The war, the people. People are scary. Better to kill oneself than to continue with the ‘bad’ life.
- Which was the broken parent that you had? That you have a parent who was so uncomfortable with parenting that was so lost in the role, that they had no idea what they were
doing, and it really hurt you - who was your lost parent?
    - I guess my father? He was working constantly and then he would not know how to connect emotionally and felt it was fine, specially during teenagerhood, they abandoned me. Both. My mum was so busy ‘thinking’ what she had to do. To be good enough herself. That she forgot that my emotional intelligence was of any use. I was an animal to be domesticated. To be ‘taught’ the way.
- Who had a bully of a parent, who didn't know how to be a parent, so they try to use violence and control instead?
    - My mum. She was controlling. She was telling me how to do and not do to things. She yelled plenty. She criticised me in both success and failure. She wouldn’t support me anyhow. She was telling me how she was better than me and how I was horrible.
