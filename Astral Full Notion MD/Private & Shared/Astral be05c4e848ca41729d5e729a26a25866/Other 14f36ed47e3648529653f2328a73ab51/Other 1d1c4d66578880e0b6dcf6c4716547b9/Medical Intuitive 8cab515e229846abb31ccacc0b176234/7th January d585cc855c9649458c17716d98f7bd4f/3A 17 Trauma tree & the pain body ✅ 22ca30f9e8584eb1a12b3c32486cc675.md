When you're ready, please take time for a good long practice, set aside an hour to create your trauma tree.

- Write down every major trauma or life-defining moment, starting from when you were in the womb all the way until now in your life.
    - Before birth - fear of not generating enough wealth - workplace abuse - lack of support
    - womb - argument with dad - genetic father neglect
    - sexual compensation from mothers sexual frustration - transfer - sexual frustration transfer & sexual projection - contrary gender
    - lack of wealth - scarcity - lack of gratitude
    - 2yo, abandonment, made to cry for hours.
    - birth - depressive mother - family member passed
    - 4, first slap
    - 5,6,7 constant abusive relationship, emotional blackmail, sexual misconduct from mother - overly sexual - incest - , neglect
    - avoidance of conflict, lack of emotional intelligence, lack of empathy, presence, intimacy, lack of intimacy
    - 8, sexual misconduct, parents been caught having sex, mom explains poorly
    - 12, mom slaps my face
    - 18, big breakup, friends loss, relationship loss, moving on to a different cycle of life to uni and abandon all relationships
    - general, didn’t have many friends, pseudo bullied at school
    - 24, break up with family, go live to the UK, abandons relationship, abandons pet

    - 31, big abuse with main partner, relationship violence, jealousy, control, passive aggressive relationship
    - 33, plant medicine, psychological stress, mental breakdown, overburnt, mental disorder, psychological instability
- Once you have this data, draw a line and branches to all the different traumas, so that you can see what it is that you're healing and you can see the work that needs to be done. In
this way it is no longer floating in the ether, is impossible or it will take forever and you can see how much you are progressing and how much it is healing.
    - I am not good
    - Not enough
    - Wrong
    - All is my fault
    - I deserve pain
    - I have to be punished
    - I have to suffer
    - Can’t trust God
    - I deserve this
    - I am unlovable
    - I can’t do this
    - I won’t do this
    - I prefer being dead than facing this again
    - I am dead
    - I don’t know how to love
    - I don’t deserve true love
    - I can’t take care of myself
    - I can’t take care of others
- Once your trauma tree is ready you can do the guided meditation for healing the traumas and dissolving the pain body. Please do the guided healing with yourself until the pain
body is completely dissolved.
- You then can muscle test: - my pain body is 70% dissolved, 50% dissolved, 20% dissolved, 10% dissolved, etc. until the day you get down to zero and your pain body is no longer
there.
