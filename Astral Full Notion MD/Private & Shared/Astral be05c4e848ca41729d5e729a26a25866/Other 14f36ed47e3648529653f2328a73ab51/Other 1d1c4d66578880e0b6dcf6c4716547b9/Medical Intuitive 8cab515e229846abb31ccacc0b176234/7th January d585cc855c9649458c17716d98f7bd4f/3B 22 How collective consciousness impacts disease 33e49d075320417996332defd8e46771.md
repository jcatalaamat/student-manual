# 3B.22 How collective consciousness impacts disease ✅

Write down :

- What's the collective consciousness of the illness that you're facing, or of the illness that your client is facing?
    - That is something out of my control. I can’t take it off without suffering and pain. That it’s forever. That I can’t take any steps towards healing it. That all is natural as it is.
- What did you learn about this illness growing up?
    - That you won’t shake it off without a sweat. That you can’t take pills to overcome it. That nothing you eat or you do impacts it. That there is no cure.
- What were your beliefs about it growing up and what is the general belief about it?
For example, even with weight loss, the belief is that weight loss is hard, that you have to starve yourself and that thin people are sick, models are anorexic, etc.
    - Beautiful people are not enjoying life. They are prostitutes, they are bulimic, they can’t take care of others. Thin people are sick. They don’t have enough to live. They are anorexic. On their bones. Dying. They are suffering. In pain. Hurting. They don’t listen to their bodies. They don’t take care of themselves. They are doing it for the wrong reasons.
- What are the beliefs that are connected to the collective consciousness of that? During the guided meditation we're going to unplug you from the collective consciousness of
illness and disease and connect you to the consciousness of wellness, full recuperation, and recovery and wellness.
    - That weight loss is hard. That you have to starve. You can’t enjoy the food you eat. That supplements don’t go together with recuperating from this illness. That you will have to leave others. You can’t spend time with the same people. You have to isolate yourself.
    - That being mad is something of psychiatric hospital. That hearing voices, God, is insane. That knowing who you are, is unsafe. That others will take advantage of you. Better isolate yourself and not be part of anything big not to be caught not to be seen. Not to stand out. Not to be detected.
