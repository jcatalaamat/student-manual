Caption/Script: Before ANY Bufo ceremony, I have my clients answer these three questions. They've changed everything about how my clients integrate their experiences:

1. "What are you willing to let die today?" (Not metaphorically. What part of your identity are you ready to release?)

2. "If this medicine gives you nothing but difficult truths, are you prepared to receive them?"

3. "Who will you be if your biggest belief systems are challenged?"

Pre-ceremony preparation isn't about getting 'good vibes' - it's about preparing for transformation. And transformation isn't always comfortable.

What question would you add to this list?
Hooks: The three questions I ask before Bufo that completely transformed my client outcomes (hint: none of them are about 'setting intentions')
CTA: If you're considering working with Bufo/5-MeO-DMT, save this post. And if you've worked with it before, what pre-ceremony question would you add?

Visual Notes: Me speaking directly to camera, with text overlays for each question. Simple outdoor setting, natural light. Perhaps transition to brief clips of nature between each question.

Inspiration Source: Developed these questions over 5+ years of ceremony work, refined based on client feedback about what helped them most
Notes: Could be expanded into a longer-form post or guide about pre-ceremony preparation. Consider filming a simplified version for TikTok and a more detailed one for IG.
