**What Still Goes Together:**

The

**Manifesto**

and

**Values**

are overarching and should be easily accessible from the main page. The

**Business Model Canvas**

ties everything together strategically. The

**Community Platform**

and

**Mobile App**

are the core products, but they should be linked to the

**DAO**

for governance and the

**Marketing and Growth**

page for promotion.

**Tips:**

- **Use Notion's features:** Embed templates, create databases, and use the visual editor to make your pages engaging.
- **Keep it organized:** Use clear headings, subpages, and linked databases to keep information structured.
- **Collaborate:** Share pages with team members and use Notion's collaboration features to work together.
- **Iterate:** Your Notion setup will evolve as your project progresses. Be open to refining and reorganizing as needed.
