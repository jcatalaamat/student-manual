## Introduction - Acknowledgement

the inner work were embarking on is  all about understanding our patterns, what caused them, understanding our behaviour, what makes us do what we do when we act from Ego, what our shadow self looks like and feels like, what the language we use means in between lines, what our body is telling, what our subconscious mind looks like, what are core wounds and what are they protecting, understanding subliminal garbage, cultural programming and different types on ancestral and inherited trauma.

## Self-Reflection

The inside is the reflection of the outside.

That which we carry inside will be reflected outside back at us.

With this only statement most of the work can be done, understood, and transcended. Whenever in doubt, in confusion, or in despair, come look at this one.

This is the most important piece of the puzzle. You have to be willing to go within. You have to be able to sit with yourself and spend time with yourself in order to unlock all the pieces laying within you. You have to get to know yourself, from the inside out. You have to know your inner child, and every other constellation that lives within. It is a journey of self-discovery, the path to enlightenment. To be able to love yourself first you need to know yourself. Then you will be able to love everyone else. Without you, there is no one else. Without you, there is nothing else.

The inside is a reflection of the outside. It is a profound concept that holds immense power and wisdom. When we delve deep within ourselves, we begin to understand that everything we carry within us is projected outwardly into the world around us. Our thoughts, emotions, beliefs, and experiences shape our perception of reality and influence the way we interact with others. 
In this simple yet profound statement, lies the key to personal growth, understanding, and transformation. When we find ourselves in moments of doubt, confusion, or despair, we can find solace and guidance by returning to this fundamental truth. It serves as a guiding light, reminding us to look within for answers, rather than seeking them externally.
To fully embrace this principle, we must be willing to embark on a journey of self-discovery. It requires us to sit with ourselves, to spend time getting to know the depths of our being. We must be courageous enough to explore the hidden aspects within us, to confront our fears, and to heal our wounds. By doing so, we unlock the pieces of ourselves that have been lying dormant, waiting to be embraced and integrated.
Through this inner exploration, we come to know our inner child—the innocent, vulnerable part of ourselves that holds our deepest desires, dreams, and wounds. We also discover the myriad of other constellations that reside within us—the different facets of our personality, the masks we wear, and the roles we play in our lives. Each aspect has its own story, its own set of experiences and beliefs that shape who we are.
This journey of self-discovery is not always easy. It requires patience, self-compassion, and a willingness to face our shadows. Yet, it is through this process that we find enlightenment and true self-love. By knowing and accepting ourselves from the inside out, we cultivate a deep sense of love, compassion, and acceptance. We become whole and authentic beings, capable of extending that love to others.
Remember, without you, there is no one else. Without you, there is nothing else. Embrace the power of looking within, for it is in this inner exploration that we find the answers, the healing, and the transformation we seek.

with great efficiency throughout our lives. However, the challenge lies in the fact that not all of our subconscious programming is beneficial to our growth and well-being. Some of these programming are limiting beliefs, fears, and negative patterns that hold us back from reaching our full potential.
To break free from these subconscious programming, we must first become aware of them. This requires a deep level of self-reflection and self-inquiry. We need to examine our thoughts, emotions, and behaviours to uncover the hidden patterns that are running our lives.
Once we have identified these patterns, we can begin the process of reprogramming our subconscious mind. This involves replacing the old, limiting beliefs with new, empowering ones. We can use techniques such as affirmations, visualization, and hypnosis to rewire our minds and create new neural pathways that support our growth and success.
It is important to remember that this process takes time and consistency. We cannot expect overnight changes. But with dedication and perseverance, we can gradually release the old programming and create a new reality for ourselves.
So, embrace the power of self-reflection and self-inquiry. Dive deep into the depths of your psyche and uncover the subconscious programming that is holding you back. And with each step forward, you will move closer to living a life of freedom, fulfilment, and joy.

## Radical Honesty

The journey will require yourself to become radically honest with yourself and your relationships with others. If you keep lying to yourself about a situation, you will forever stay locked and repeat the same patterns over and over again.

Inside of you there are many aspects. Imagine these as mini copies of you, they have their own thoughts, feelings and emotions, and there are hundreds, if not thousands. They all have something to say. You as you know yourself are nothing more than the convergence of all these aspects into one. There is also your soul, who is guiding you towards your highest expression of yourself, or higher timeline, to becoming the image of that of your higher self.

In order to see the light, you must shade the darkness.

In order to shade the darkness, you must accept it.

There will be lots of stuff coming out of you as you step into this path of self-discovery and as you begin to get in touch with other aspects of you, the darkness of each one of them is going to come out, into your awareness. You must hold yourself in all these moments, accepting what is, and who these parts are. What they went through, and the mechanisms they used to survive in life.

These aspects are fragments of you, of your psyche, frozen in time, in your emotional body, or astral body, and they are still reliving the situation that split them from you on the first place.

Their consciousness has not evolved, as they are not an integrated part of the one running yourself. They are like small versions of you, little you’s, and they live inside your psyche town, and they all get a vote into what your reaction to life is in any given action.

Radical Honesty means that when you get to meet each part of yourself, you don’t look away from what you find. That you don’t lie to yourself trying to hide some aspect of you. These aspects are not you, they are reflections of what you were made feel, think, and believe, and they may not be very pretty at times.

Virtues to cultivate are going to be self-awareness, non-judgement, courage, determination, strength, thoroughness, benevolence, understanding, integrity and nurturing.

## Self-Enquiry

You are going to cultivate the ability to sit with yourself and take yourself into a journey to the depths of your psyche and emotional body.

You can’t afford letting one minute more not knowing why you do what you do. You can’t afford letting one minute more not knowing what is your intention for everything you do or don’t do. Knowing the reason you do anything and everything, will set you free. Not knowing really is looking away from oneself, bypassing, not taking responsibility for yourself, lying to oneself, distancing from the truth of who you are.

It is going to take discipline, and you will have to be thorough, if you want to sustain positive changes in your life and the life of others you touch.

The alternative is to remain asleep, each one in their own different level, and allow the natural course of your subconscious and wounded mind to take you on a journey of repetition and crashing against the same shores again and again until an aspect of you decides to change and changes the overall vote that your psyche needs to take a new path of action.

If you follow through, it will release an almost immeasurable amount of pain and suffering, and it will exponentially elevate your position in life, expanding yourself into a new way of being, with an ever opening heart, and will certainly allow you to become the wildest version of yourself you’ve ever dared to dream of.

It will most probably be a very challenging path, and it will be worth it. The outcome of releasing all the extra weight you’ve been carried for decades if not millennia will definitely be felt, and once release, the lightness will carry you effortlessly.

## Understanding Your Story

It all depends how far you want to go.

You may be here to heal some clear patterns that are annoying in your life, or you may be here because you want to be the highest version of yourself. You are the one who chooses how far you go. You may come in and out of this process, and leave for some time and then come back to it when it feels like you need more of it.

I feel like the better I feel, the better I live, the faster I manifest, the more I create. The lighter I am the faster and further I go.

All is trauma.

You’ve got to tattoo that one.

There is big trauma and small trauma.

It’s a spectrum.

You can choose softer words to describe it and yet it all is the same thing in a different scale and weight.

Anywhere where there was a split in you, an aspect was created, that was trauma.

Anywhere where you didn’t understand what was going on and didn’t manage to make peace with it, that remained as trauma.

It is a split personality, an aspect, because a part of you that didn’t manage to make sense of it did not manage to move on from that. In some space or dimension, that part of you remained intact, frozen, waiting to be figured out.

And to be figured out, it required to manifest the same issue in life for to be able to be faced again, understood, and move on from it.

Your story is full of these.

Most of these wounds were created when you were young, very young, and some other during teenage years. From there, mostly you increased the severity of the neural pathway that reinforced that pattern, that trauma.

Whenever something overloaded you, trauma was created. A tightening in your body, and potentially a disassociation and in some cases PTSD.

We all have PTSD in some form, in some hidden place in our psyche.

We often times need the right person to trigger us right there, someone who can mirror the original wound and replicate similar environment to enable such wound to come to surface with the intention of being healed.

We are the ones creating the situations around us in order to have a chance to overcome them and integrate the wound that was caused on us.

It is our natural ability as human beings. We heal, and in order to heal we bring up what needs to come out in order to be transformed.

It is our power. Our gift.

Some may see it as a curse. Some may resist the idea that we create trouble for ourselves in order to heal.

Well, there are two ways.

The unconscious or the conscious way.

You either let your higher-self guide you towards a situation that will explode on your face in order for you to learn from it, or you guide yourself consciously through your psyche looking for all these places that need attention for you to heal.

Most of our lives we’ve done this unconsciously. We have let life teach us the ‘hard’ way.

This is how we’ve awakened. There was a time where we were not conscious and eventually after enough trauma and heart break we began being aware.

It didn’t choose everyone. Not everyone went through this awakening, almost as if in order to be ‘awakened’ required a special threshold of trauma, not too little and not too much, in order to remain socially functional and yet out of the norm.

The black sheep.

Or we were born in an environment where personal development was openly discussed or received guidance from someone special to us young in our age.

Or it was mainstream.

Who cares.

The fact is that we’re aware of what is happening inside of us whilst most of us live asleep a life that seems empty from the outside.

I know it is not empty, yet some lack the determination to look within for answers, and cover their plate with whatever distraction they can in order to remain asleep.

Many of you may have been there.

Alcohol, sex, drugs, food, work, studies, charity, tv, sports, shopping, and basically anything that can be turned into an obsession, will become a coping mechanism for the emptiness we feel inside.

Like ancient cultures say, anything when in excess can be poison. Same goes the other way around, anything when in moderation can be medicine.

All of these ones can allow for us to disassociate from reality, distancing ourselves from the truth we carry inside. They can be a distraction to our evolution. Sometimes they are part of our evolution, helping us to uncover that which is not right in our lives.

Yes you may say ‘but this activity took me out of the crap’ and yet it had an expiration date that’s clearly passed. Sometimes we use steps of a ladder and later we don’t need those steps of the ladder anymore.

Sometimes a ‘bad’ habit allows you go step a little bit deeper in the mud so you can realise you’re actually wet and dirty.

We’re not meant to just stop the ‘bad’ habits. We’re meant to understand why are there for. What are they protecting, what are they a cover for.

When many little traumas accumulate into bigger ones, extreme coping mechanisms and imbalances happen within our system. This may be called energetic blockages, chakra imbalances, emotional wounds, wounded soul, teared auric field, heart break.

There are main wounds in your system and they are the priority to be worked on, and yet soon after the secondary and other smalls more subtle wounds will come up for the initiate who’s looking for truth and self-realisation.

Like a coiling snake, they will intertwine, like in a videogame, you will work in some minor issues and then the big boss will be revealed. Then you will celebrate and soon after another minor challenge will span, to soon after become the big boss once again.

These are waves of light and healing into your life and soul, and they are coming no matter what you do in life. There are deadlines you will not miss, you will only manage to reach them in a better or worse position, better or less well equipped.

You can’t avoid your healing, only delay it. And eventually you will learn the lessons you came here to learn.

The question is, are you going to do the minimum to pass the game or are you going to do the best you can, since anyway this is your only ride?

Are you going to be a human that adds to this planet, or that subtracts from it?

Yes, you’ve got to enjoy the ride. And who says that the same intelligence that moves your blood, regenerates your cells and make all your life systems work cannot also carry your consciousness forwards?

You’ve got to let go of control and turn inwards until you find your own knowing about how things work, how they turn you on and what exactly are you here for.

## Body Wisdom

Your body carries more information than the one in your conscious and subconscious mind.

The body has existed far more than your consciousness has. Therefor the intelligence that the body has has evolved much more than the one in your awareness.

Each and every cell of your body carries information about you and about what’s happened to you. In a way you could also see each one of these as mini-mini versions of you, or voters from your psychic village, and in a way they group in different body organs and processes that would be like neighbourhoods in your psyche village.

Each group votes and assert a conclusion about different aspects of you, and from there they become the subconscious whole of you.

You are going to gain awareness over your body, how it feels and how it reacts to each and every thought, emotion, and situation in your life.

It will be a life-long process, and it will bring about the transformation you are seeking.

This awareness will be a part of your intuition, as you learn to be more present with how your body reacts in each and every situation.

This intuition can be seen as your natural ability of self-healing, and the same way that when you cut yourself you heal, you will be able to heal the psyche and emotional wounds.

Your subconscious mind is bringing things to awareness by ways of creating situations in your life that resemble those ones that created the splits within you, in order for you to learn the lesson and to integrate that which happen for you to move forward.

Some would say that consciousness is born in the cell, and when grouped together into your whole system you become aware of who you are, a cluster of smaller consciousnesses.

Everything that you need to know is already within yourself.

All the answers are found within one.

The challenge here is to overcome the disconnection with oneself that we have inherited from a very long time of collective unconsciousness. All this has contributed into the desensitisation of one’s inner wisdom and intelligence.

Reconnecting with yourself will bring about awareness, and information that has been long kept in the depths of your being.

The body knows how to heal.

It is our job to get our mind out of the way in order for it to do what it needs in order for you to heal.

## Subconscious Programming

What do we understand by subconscious programming? This has to do with the way the brain works and how we learn as human beings.

Other beings in this world learn with a very strong genetic code that tells them how to behave once they are born, most knowing where to go and how to be in order to survive, and many need very little time with their procreators, if anything at all, to understand how the world works and how they have to act to survive in it.

In our case, we spend a lot more time as a vulnerable living being, needing lots of care until we reach a ripened age where we can begin to take care of ourselves fully.

We learn by repetition. We learn by context.

This is the reason that children begin to speak words not because we tell them what they mean, but because they make relational connections with what happens around them.

When the child has understood that table is the object that holds other things on top and where people sit around to eat, they understand it because they analyse subconsciously the use of the words as a relation to one another, eventually, the concept becomes isolated from the other concepts and the relation becomes of 1-1. Table means that object, that is obvious to us.

If we were to be dropped in a country where we don’t speak the language that’s spoken, we would begin to relate words that we hear being repeated with the actions that happen around those words. Eventually we would begin to connect what some words are spoken around what actions, and we would begin to discern more and more how these ones connect.

It’s like we would use all the possible senses in order to make connections in the space around us for us to get a meaning about what things are.

Some are clear as the sky, when the same sound is connected to picking the glass of water, we understand that that is water.

Some aren’t as clear as that, as we let behind the physical world and begin to deepen our relation to feelings, relational actions between people, and especially when what is said does not match the reality of the action that occurs after it.

When we learn that water is that liquid, transparent, mostly contained in a glass, sometimes in a recipient, we can’t but not realise that if someone asks for water and we give lemonade, something must be going on there. That relation makes no sense to us, and it either is because we do not understand correctly what water is of there is a hidden reason that a person connected two distinct concepts as one, when they aren’t.

Now this is where it gets interesting.

Most of the world rules and organisation we have learnt with this process. We have learnt not to cross during red light, how to sit on the table, what cutlery to use for what, where to get what we need to sustain ourselves, where we are supposed to sleep, to make our necessities, and other bigger and more abstracts concepts like government and businesses. We did not all of them learn them through school, we learnt them when we heard about them, relating them to the information that was available and solidifying it as time passed.

We have done this diligently and solidly.

Once we touched fire for the first time, we never did anymore. It stayed ‘burned’ in our minds, and we never needed to repeat it anymore to prove it’s relation to ourselves.

When we were in the savanna, we needed to know what was safe and what wasn’t, in order for us not to accidentally meet a lion that would eat us. We needed it to know what berries were safe to eat, what the clouds meant for us to get shelter before the rain, what tracks were from what animal, in order to hunt, and how the space felt around us in order to make sure we were safe.

This associations were first evolving from our reptilian brain, in charge of our fight-flight-freeze mode, in order to tell us what was safe, what wasn’t, and how to act in a situation where our life depended upon.

When we learnt how to survive something, we repeated it again, reinforcing the neural path of such action. The reptilian brain was the first part of the brain to evolve, as it is closer to our spinal cord, which sends electrical impulses to the whole of the body to take quick split second actions in order for us to survive.

And what does this have anything to do with how we behave in life? How our relationships are? What our goals and dreams are and the potential for us to reach them?

It has everything to do with it.

Everything.

The physical world is easy to create connections with. Table means table, water means water.

Now what happens when we used the same method of learning by context when we begin to deepen into the relation we humans have with each other?

What does love mean? What does respect mean? What does grace mean?

And more importantly, how did we learn these?

When dad says he loves mum, and then goes out cheating his wife, and comes back home carrying such energetic signature, what do we learn about love? And respect?

When mum wants to keep her little secret with you, about what she went shopping for, even if it is for a surprise, what do we learn about truth? What do we learn when she keeps information from her husband when he’s asking what’s she been up to?

When the boy or the girl hear a parent saying something that does not relate to the truth of what the child has seen or been in the action with, what is he or she learning about this situation?

Is he or she delusional? Did he not understand the situation and so it needs to re-evaluate what some physical concepts are? Or is he or she understanding that truth has different shades to it? He may not even know that is lying, yet. She may understand that in order to keep a happy situation occurring a disassociation between what was and what was told must be different.

That’s a happy life.

If we have mostly learnt a language by context, repetition, and being witness of reality, what can we learn about personal relationships and the relationship with the world?

This is the crux of all things.

If your parents taught you good values, you apply good values. If your parents taught you more negative values, you have probably embraced them as your truth, your reality, and seem normal to you.

Two people can look at the same colour, but how do we know they are actually seeing the same colour? They both made a connection between a word and a colour, but no one is actually inside the other one seeing the same colour with their own eyes.

How two people understand what a glass of water means, despite some may fill it up more than others, they might not meet with the meaning of what love is. How to love each other. What respect means.

Understand that these examples are simple.

Imagine 10, 20, 30 years of unconsciousness around this process, where every day, every moment, we are learning and re-influencing the same neural path of action.

We are talking of thousands of days where we were mostly unaware, learning how the world revolved around us, how the connections were made, being imprinted with everything that happened in front of us. Many tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands hours of behavioural repetition in front of us, teaching us the reality that is, for us.

That is a very strong neural learning, where the paths that repeat become more familiar and available for us, and those that we haven’t walked so much, harder for us to take on a daily basis.

This is all proved by science, and should probably be familiar for you to hear. The intention here is to get as close to this truth as possible as you can. It allows for detachment and acceptance of what is.

You did have not much to say about this process as you learnt it. You did not have a choice to learn this way.

What you have control over is about what you do about it now. How you take responsibility for who you are and where to go from there.

What are you going to do with your subconscious programming? Let it guide your life as you learnt it? Passed down generation after generation, where same paths and patterns reinforced themselves since the beginning of time?

Or are you going to decide that you prefer to live your life in your own terms? Free of all this behavioural garbage that doesn’t work for you anymore?

The choice is yours.

## Language

Words are powerful.

Thoughts are real things.

Everything that exists came first from a thought, then to a word, and eventually an action.

That is why the old say says you’ve got to align between what you think, what you say, and how you act.

When these three systems are in balance, you are a pure beaming of light in life.

Until then, you’re on your journey of self-realisation, upgrading yourself as you are, allowing life to make it’s process through you, like an empty vessel for something greater to come through you.

The way you speak defines your own reality.

Two people may go through the same space and experience two completely different worlds. It all is in your mind.

What you say is the experience that you create for yourself.

The way you speak explains how you feel inside.

Not only words have a meaning, but some of them have a different meaning depending on the language you’re speaking.

Culturally, a word will mean something to a whole nation than to another one.

Our verbal expression is a direct correlation with our inner world.

Words to consider:

- Want: to lack
- But: negates everything that comes before
- Always: impossible
- Never: impossible
- Just: an excuse to not uncover what the pain is
- So: it’s not your time to speak, or you won’t be adding anything up
- Can’t: won’t, manipulation
- Try: fail
- Not knowing: I am not willing to know
- Too: protection, not willing to go deeper
- Because: justification, often from the Ego

Solidification:

- This is who I am
- This is how it is
- This kind of people don’t do this

Word work like black magic spells, when you talk negatively to yourself you’re strengthening the same neural pathway, which becomes more available to be used next time you are in the same place.

Sometimes you may be in a dark place and use these ones subconsciously so the horse poop hits the fan sooner and faster so you can get yourself out of the hole as soon as possible.

A way to use language is affirmations, they are like white magic spells, the more you repeat them the more you call them in, and of course they need to be accompanied of your belief and trust and knowing that they are true. All in its own level.

Fake it till you make it.

This is where they say to intend to use positive speaking whenever possible, even if you don’t truly feel it, so you keep the negative energy away from the words that pull energy down.

‘I am not so well’ instead of ‘I’m bad’ – the subconscious mind does not understand negation. That’s why affirmations are done in positive.

‘I am getting better and better’ instead of ‘I am ill’.

‘I am progressively and steadily learning Spanish’ instead of ‘I don’t know Spanish’.

The more you think and speak about something, the more chances it becomes real.

This is part of the quantum paradigm, where all possibilities already exist in another dimension and you’re attracting them to you the more you connect to them.

You are calling in the reality where that which you desire already exists. You align yourself with a dimension that already exists in the quantum multiverse so it manifests physically in your life.

If you master language you will master your life.

There are examples in different cultures where people who didn’t have a word for something could not actually conceive it’s existence. Something you can’t conceptualise does not exist for you, yet it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist at all.

Align your thoughts, words and actions and you will master the truth of who you are.

## Core Wounds

There are wounds that are going to come up again and again, and then they are going to come up again and keep coming up more.

These are your core wounds.

You’re going to think that you’ve already gone through them and then they are going to be there again whenever you go deep enough.

We’re talking about mum and dad wounds. And you will be working on something else and they are going to pop up at the end of what you’re working on.

We’re talking about 20 to 30 years of accumulating the same wound around similar patterns.

All the grief and anger that you weren’t able to process when you were a child, teen, and young adult, will be there waiting for you. And most of it will probably be around of these mum and dad wounds.

Yes, ancestral patterns and genetic issues will also be part of what your core wounds are. These are the neural paths that have most been repeated in your life, and even though other patterns were created on top of this, in order to reach the bottom line you will probably have to go through these many, many times.

Things to beware that your mind will be telling you:

- This process is not working
- I can’t be working on this again
- I’ve already solved this
- It’s going to take forever
- It’s never going to end
- I don’t want to do this anymore

The mind will be saying anything it can in order for you to stop growing. Safe is the pathway of the Ego, so the Ego will be trying to stop you in every step of the path.

This is being in the growth zone, instead of the comfort zone.

In order to be able to go through these waypoints much easier, you will have to develop your own concept of Anchors.

Anchors are points of Truth that you have validated again and again, so that eventually they become like beacons of light that mark the way, so when you find the same stone again and again, you can remind yourself of where and what are you aiming at.

Anchors may be like the following:

- After a process of releasing, you have found yourself to feel extremely great for days after the process
- After longs processes of releasing, you have found many signs in your path that validate what you were going through
- Your intuition has grown a lot and you have used that intuition to move forward and you have trusted that clearly
- You have learnt to realise that after long ups you have a down, and that after many downs you have a big up, a big breakthrough

You may also be in need to find a bigger WHY you are doing this.

If you are doing this process in order to clear some stone from your path, and you don’t have the process as the method in order for you to be the highest version of yourself, you will repeatedly get stuck on the same patterns again and again, and you will only manage to delay yourself and to bring about more suffering for yourself.

Bigger WHYs may be like:

- I am doing this to break the ancestral patterns that my lineage have been carrying for generations and potentially eons
- I am not going to be like my parents to my future children
- I am not going to give any trauma to my children
- I am doing it so the world becomes a better place and I can shine the light I carry inside
- I am doing this because the more I do it the lighter I feel and it’s more important to go through everything I can in order to be the lightest I can, so I will be at my highest sooner and for longer
- The path to enlightenment will reward me more than thinking I have to make money / have a good relationship / grow my business / have a greater career – as the path to enlightenment will encompass all of these in the highest possible way aligned to me

Anchors are literally there in order for you to stay centred in the eye of the storm. So when the shit hits the fan the next time you don’t go into places like:

- This means I’m totally wrong
- This proves that God doesn’t exist
- This proves that everything I thought was right is a lie

Do you get what I mean?

Shit is going to hit the fan, and it’s going to hit the fan many times.

The key is into knowing how to face it. Into getting better at cleaning up every time it happens. Into minimising your downtime. Into seeing the shit about to hit the fan so it doesn’t get you by surprise.

You are going to need to upgrade your BIG WHY over time. You will need to because you’re going to have so much light coming into your life, that darkness will also seem bigger. In order to overcome that you will need a greater reason to continue to move forward, and it will be worth it.

The universe knows you better than you know yourself, and what you thought was right for you years ago turns out to be something completely different now, and this is the reason why surrendering to the process is important, to a method that works for you, with your own Anchors and your own WHY.

The universe will surprise you in ways you can’t yet dream to imagine.

It will find the sweetest way to bring you the sweetest joy and fulfilment through your wildest desires.

## Social Conditioning

Social conditioning will build upon your Core Wounds, and also will bring its own flavour to the equation.

Because social conditioning goes further than your life. It affected your parents, grandparents, and you get the drill.

Social conditioning are things like:

- Money is hard to make
- Life is hard
- Relationships aren’t easy
- It’s impossible to make a business of your own
- Someone will come and take everything from you
- Rich people are assholes
- Humans can’t be trusted
- Boys don’t cry
- Girls have to be nice
- It’s better to give in with something that makes you half happy than risk your life
- Letting go of the past is impossible
- Drown your pains in a bottle
- I will always be poor
- No matter what I do I will always fail
- Politicians are corrupt
- People don’t change
- Keep your head down, it’ll be safer
- Don’t argue
- Don’t go out of the norm
- Success will eat you
- Showing emotions is weak
- Is wrong to have anger
- Avoid conflict at all costs

You get the drill.

There are other type of social conditioning that would be race, gender, generalisations and historical events, such as:

- Black people are inferior
- Women should get paid less
- Germans are Nazis
- Gay people are monsters
- Russians are bad
- It’s ok for some people to be slaves
- Child labour is ok
- It’s probably her fault
- Women are whores
- Men are assholes
- Rich people are the ones destroying the planet
- Governments only care about themselves
- The world is fucked

It’s not your fault.

You have inherited these.

Maybe not many of them, but yet some, and to some extent.

Don’t pretend to yourself you wouldn’t be a person that ‘has this racist belief’ or that ‘thinks this way about men, or women’.

The truth is that to some extend, we all carry it. We are all reflections of each other.

Maybe your pattern has a 1% of that one, and the other one has 0.5% of the other. Still is some.

This work is about radical honesty. Is not about looking away from the parts of us that were indoctrinated into a set of beliefs that we didn’t have a choice to believe in. They were programmed onto us.

Our responsibility is to find all the ugly code that defines us and upgrade it to the next better version.

You have to admit to yourself that yeah you may be a little racist, and you may have to admit to yourself that you think that men are inherently better than women. It’s all been programmed onto us.

Looking away from your own shadow will only serve for your spiritual ego to keep growing, and to learn to hide better, which will bring about suffering in moments you would have preferred not to.

It will also slow down your own evolution, path and success in life.

If some part of you subconsciously belief that you’re better than someone else, gender, race, or for whatever other reason, you will keep attracting situations that will challenge that belief. And guess what. People who’d fall in those categories that you haven’t brought to light, they won’t like you either. Subconsciously they will know that you hold something unfairly against them.

You won’t find that fulfilling relationship, group of friends, your business won’t take off, you will find the same type of blocks along the way, you will not find the abundance you deserve.

We ALL HAVE IT.

Lying to yourself is futile.

It’s easier to start with:

- What part of me doesn’t like this kind of people?
- And this kind of people?
- What part of me thinks is better than the rest?
- What part of me thinks that they would be better following me?
- What part of me thinks is superior than the rest?
- What part of me thinks is okay for some people to go through something, but not others?
- What part of me thinks I deserve something more than others do?

The truth is that we’re all equal.

We had a different starting point, a different story, and with that, a different path of learning.

Here there may be groups of people talking about soul contracts, pre-agreed contracts, soul journey, past lives & people who sacrifice for the greater good and the greater learning.

I won’t get into any of that. It doesn’t bring me joy to look into that.

I intend to live my life the best I can every day, forgiving myself for what I didn’t see yesterday and being grateful I am able to see it today.

My only intention is for my own evolution, and as I evolve, so do the people around me, carried by my love and energy as so do the people around them.

When enough of this, all the people in the world will be touched, and we will finally be beginning to transcend our human condition in a global scale.

This means we can’t blame ourselves for the issues that are all around the world. We have to learn to see them with ‘compassion’ and benevolence. To understand what they mean and what they say about us and how we can use them in order for us to break free from the chains we carry from the past.

This is the only way forward.

As Buddha said: Love yourself first, and then others.

You will only be able to guide others into that which you’ve already gone yourself.

There’s no point for you spiritual Ego to be complaining about what happens in the other side of the world if that complaining is not bringing about any change in yourself. Instead, focus on what you need to change in order to accept, forgive, and teach others.

## Ancestral Inheritance

In my own work I don’t make a fuss to clearly differentiate if what I am working on is an ancestral trauma, social conditioning, core wound, etc.

It’s not needed to know what it is in order for it to be cleared. It won’t bring about any special truth or realisation to know the difference.

At the most for some it will be brain candy.

And most of the times, it will be a mix of some.

Something that was an ancestral trauma became a social conditioning and then again an ancestral trauma to become a core wound passed from parents to children.

We’d call an ancestral trauma something that was more accented inside your blood lineage, like the lack of love from a father or the punishment of a mother, passed down from generation to generation until your parents passed it onto you, potentially becoming a core wound, and yet not necessarily.

Sometimes ancestral wounds appear more clearly after time working in core wounds, and sometimes something that was a wound from this life has been worked enough to now begin to work on an ancestral level.

The good thing about ancestral patterns is that allow us to gain perspective and detach ourselves more easily.

These wounds appear to be cleared when we’re more at ease with the fact that no one is to be blamed and sole responsible for that wound to have been there on the first place.

Hard enough if you intend to find where a wound has originated, you’d probably go back in time to the beginning of time, if any.

When you are ready to see your parents as someone closer to you, something closer like you, or extensions of you, you will begin to connect more with your ancestors and their lineage and will be able to feel to where and what avenues some patterns took direction from. You will begin to see that people are just people, like you, and that patterns and trauma are more alien energies, like they are not intrinsic parts of our being, that have travelled. Almost as if we were talking about bacteria, viruses, and other co-dependent types of life that needed a host in order to survive and multiply.

Here you will begin to connect more to Oneness. The feeling of being interconnected with others. The realisation that time is an illusion, and everything is currently happening at the same time. To your omnipresence abilities and the ability to heal the past from this time.

Ancestral patterns may be like:

- Absent father
- Raging mother
- Violence
- Shaming
- Drugs, alcohol
- Sexual debauchery
- Evil on itself
- Non existing God
- Deep engrained Church beliefs
- Punishment as correction
- Patriarchal beliefs
- Women disempowerment
- Deep feeling of impossibility
- Failure

Many of these and many more will be based on things like:

- Not being good enough
- Being a failure
- Otherworldly forces and powers greater than us
- Separation
- Death

Sometimes we have some positive things preventing us from changing:

- Fear of Truth & its repercussions
- Fear of Change & now knowing
- Fear of Success & being alone
- Fear of Abundance & having it taken from us

And what mostly blocks us:

- Fear of failure
- Fear of chastising
- Fear of losing love
- Fear of monetary loss

These patterns will come up as you work on yourself. You don’t need to have a to-do list in these subjects unless some call your attention, or you feel the call.

Your mum trauma with abandonment may connect to a Church belief about God, an ancestral trauma about mum being absent because of death or illness, and a fear of failure because of having lacked enough resources to start a business of your own.

The possibilities are endless.

There are a lot of ancestors on your line of lineage.

If we go back 10 generations, we’re talking about some 1024 ancestors.

10 generations could be something between 250-400 years.

Now expand to the rest of the human timeline. How many people come before you that were needed for you to be here now?

We’re talking about trillions, quadrillions, etc… Depending how far you want to go before you begin to lose it.

Yes, many people say we carry the DNA of only 7 generations, and that ancestral healing can only be done up to 7 generations. I don’t particularly fancy this, I don’t feel into it, I don’t care. It doesn’t bring me joy to look into it. I prefer to believe in my reality I can bring healing and will carry some sort of genetic code from as further as it is needed for something to exist.

Maybe your father wasn’t emotional, but his father was really mean and distant, the previous died in a war, and the previous had a very strong unhealthy masculine. During generations we’re decreasing the level of trauma into a level that we can now observe and deal with.

Years ago our parents wouldn’t have thought or known about the concept of shadow and realising of social conditioning. Before that we would have probably been internalised in a psychiatric hospital.

The possibilities are greater now. Seeming to be in a level where we can finally are ready to do the work of transcending that which has kept us in chains for millennia.

We are one of the first few generations that can and are doing the work of liberation from that which has been in the darkness or we weren’t safe enough to even think about focusing on it.

## Genetic imprints

Genetic conditions may be coming from ancestral trauma, passed down generation after generation so many times that a gene manifested or that a particular physical conditioned flagged itself active and to existence in order to mark that which was in the emotional and astral bodies for so long.

The physical form is the last in which energy manifests into. This means that when a perturbance exists in the energetic bodies may eventually appear in the physical. If it exists in the physical can clearly be seen in the energetic bodies.

This doesn’t mean we have to go against science. This means that an energetic approach may have great synergy with a scientific approach. If we know the emotional roots of a physical issue, we can work both in the physical and energetic bodies at the same time, maximising success.

I mean, if you for real want to make something happen, are you going to go down one route or multiple, making sure that your whole being in all its dimensions is in alignment?

Physical illness comes from an energetic one. Sometimes they are so rooted that deep energy work alone may not be sufficient.

Sometimes it may be so sudden for the being that we may intend to question the whole paradigm of existence. We spoke about this earlier ‘this means that nothing is true’ or ‘God doesn’t exist’, lacking to find the greater picture.

A hunger death from the other side of the world is not greater or less than an early cancer.

They are all here to show us something about us. The reason for this, unknown to me at this very moment.

Parents have a great power of manifestation on their children. If parents see children as a failure, children will pick that up and manifest and prove it right to the parents.

Pets clearly get illnesses in order for owners to be healthy and to express their love and gratitude.

Humans can do that too.

It’s an easy root to go and blame something in order for us to stop going deeper and finding greater purpose to something that didn’t come with a manual - life.

Maybe the grandparents and great grandparents conditioning and likelihood of getting a physical ailment combined and attracted the same all together in order for a pattern to clearly come up and be unavoidable – illness, death.

This has subconsciously been planned in order to grow the ancestral lineage, and cannot be dismissed as ‘futile’ or use it as a way to give up on life.

We still deal with the emotional pain that this brings up, and we face it with the highest possible face that we have. Understanding, accepting, forgiving. The BIG WHY may need to be upgraded here.

There is one thing that Ram Das used to say, and it’s one of my dearest and greatest teachings of all times.

Accept what is.

If you do not accept what is in front of you, you are going against life.

Nothing can go against life. It will perish you, destroy you, kill you.

To accept what is we need a great deal of self-compassion, benevolence, forgiveness, grace, and a sense of a greater purpose.

How can we use this horrendous possible unfair situation that has taken such big toll on someone who didn’t particularly deserve it?

Make profit from something that feels horrible. Make connection with it, become one with it, let it break your heart out and merge with it. Come out the other side grateful that it wasn’t you and put in place whatever is needed in the world so no one else has to ever go through the same thing that you did.

And this should be anyone else’s BIG WHY anyway.

Don’t let anyone else go through anything like you’ve ever gone through before.

Make sure no child has to go through what you went, what your partner went through, what other people you know went through, and then extend it to basic needs, that no one is hunger, that there’s no illness, that there is no separation, and where there is love everywhere.

Everything I do, I do for the children.

I can’t avoid having gone through what I’ve gone through.

What I can do is make sure I do everything in my power to make sure that no more children go through the same.

This means education. Lots of educations. Lots of inner work. Make sure I am impeccable with my words, actions and thoughts. Making sure that wherever I go I add up instead of subtract.

Forgive myself when I fail, when I pull people down, and then stand up as fast as possible, taking care of myself first, and continue moving forward learnings, expanding, and sharing with others what I’ve learnt, both in a conscious and also energetic way.

Let my vibration be the medicine for others. For what I’ve seen and what I’ve grown, what I’ve learnt. Transfer it to every place I walk and to everyone I touch even if it is through our quantum field in the same space and yet a different time.

That the day I am in my death bed I am at peace with myself and my addition to the world. No regrets. Not feeling like I let someone down, the world down.

That my compass was always looking to grow and to expand. To be myself. And that the becoming onto myself was encompassing the wellbeing of all things in this planet and any other.

## World Views

(views that are greater than the other buckets, like organisations more powerful than us, deep state, big corporations, illuminati, conspiracy theories)

## Subliminal Garbage

Music, TV, Series, Books, People, from the present, early adulthood, and in greater amount childhood. All the shitty energy from shitty people you’ve ever been close to, supermarkets, shopping malls, from same space and different times.

Organise room, throw old stuff, what you feel when you don’t want to throw stuff. Emotional attachments. Cutting chords. All is there.

## Decluttering

Things are energy and energy attracts energy.

What your physical reality is, is what your mind and inner space is.

## Quantum Nature of Reality

Where focus goes energy goes

Quantum field of possibilities

Thoughts are real things

Multidimensionality

Interconnected state of possibility of particles of light and energy

### Spirit Paradigm

Spirit guides etc, star beings, etc, get the positive, have fun, what and how you want it is how it is in combination for the earth akashic field and the people who believed in the past. Buddha was so powerful he didn’t need others in his path to get enlightened. The 100 monkeys.

### Reality Shifting

Align to the reality you want, call it in, feel what it feels to be there, in theory if you would have enough power, you could truly be there. Normally we jump to the closest multiverse reality we have, sometimes back and forth, until we have big jumps what we call changing the tracks. Ultimately, I follow highest timeline which is the one I would mostly enjoy no matter what and that’s available to me. And realign to it every day, at every moment.

## Introduction – Deep Work

Day 2 is going to be all about going deep with the different methods and techniques in order to transform and let go of all the limiting beliefs, outdated programs, detrimental patterns and stuck traumatic emotions.

Day 2 is all about learning to do the work. To transform all the limitations and accept our journey as we open up to each and every Imprint of trauma and integrate every aspect of ourselves into the new upgraded version of ourselves and our constant centre.

## Emergency Toolkit

- Shit is going to come up – once you open this door there is no way back, not an easy one at least.
- ‘It’s too much’, ‘Too tiring’, ‘It doesn’t work’, ‘Too overwhelming’, ‘It is going to kill me’, ‘I’m going on circles’, ‘It’s retraumatising me’ – this is the MIND. The Ego. It will try anything for you to stop. Realise the Mind’s job is to keep you safe, and for the Mind safe means repeating the same pattern learnt, because that disassociation was what kept you from dying when you were young, and yet it won’t be the solution moving forwards as you know, and it hasn’t been for a very long time. Imagine you’re with a broken arm or a dislocated shoulder, or a bullet wound. To put the arm back together, the shoulder in place, or remove the bullet from the wound, it’s going to hurt. You are going to have to go through it, there’s no workaround. You can’t pretend to close and sew the wound up with the bullet inside. Same here. You can’t heal when the stuff is still inside of you, and it may hurt as you pull it out. It won’t always, and it will come with practice. You will get used to the process and it will become easier and, in some cases, eventually ecstatic, even when you’re going to be heartbrokenly crying. Eventually it will become the Divine Comedy, where you will see yourself from behind and you will realise the play you’re playing and the emotion that’s scheduled for release. Creating a new neural pathway means going against the ones you already have - which may be very detrimental, toxic, and unlogic to the heart.
- Anchor. Validate. Confirm – This is very important, because the more light you hold the more dark the darkness will be when it comes up. You have to make sure you can keep yourself afloat the days when the boat is upside down. Write down every big win you make about yourself. Every big realisation you have. Every moment of enlightenment you reach. Every validation you get from a previous reflection. Every confirmation you get through any form of sign. Record everything of this. Make sure you have this close by whenever the shit hits the fan. It will allow you to see that not everything is lost (if not anything is lost) the days where everything feels lost. Eventually you won’t need a list, whenever you have revalidated yourself and the process so many times that when the shit hits the fan you already knew it was going to and you were already waiting for it.
- Be gentle with yourself, be benevolent – what you are doing is the work of a lifetime and it is there to recover your freedom as a whole human being – don’t intend to solve your life in one hour, day, week or month.
- Make peace with the waves – when the day is good and you clear good that’s good. When the day is bad and conflict explodes and everything seems like a mess, is good too. The less you resist the changing tides of the process the more balancing the waters will begin. If you are attached to always be ‘good’ and that’s ‘easy’ the more prone you will be to get a bad day and a really strong tide in order for you to ‘wake up’ and harmonise yourself. You will be getting what you need to keep you close to 0. Enlightenment is a fine balance, no disturbances. This process is similar to it. The less you resist how it’s coming out of you, the easier it will become.
- After a good day – expect a bad one. After a bad one – expect a good one. Before a breakthrough – expect a big death. After a big break through – expect stagnation. – Life is a constant expansion/contraction – nothing different here. Make peace with this and you will see it coming sooner and dance with it easier.
- Combo day – if you get two good days before a bad one, celebrate! You may need 2 bad days before a good one – allow yourself to be what you need to be in order to heal. Often times, we get out of a dark place, and we have 5 good days, and then we get another process on the day 6, and ‘fuck I shouldn’t be having a bad day, I worked so much last week, and I’ve only had 5 good days!’ – keep track of good and bad days, you don’t have control of what you require in order to heal – maybe those are the perfect timings for the healing to happen – and ‘too much, too tired, etc’ are going to come up here like in many other places – you don’t get to choose if you heal, only how. Be the best ready you can so when the healing wave and upgrade hits you, you can balance it out the best you can without falling (and the same is for big, good news waves! They can all destabilise you!)
- When you are ready – you can face the clearing. When you aren’t – you can notice the slight bypassing – in this moment benevolence and gentleness is key – you are noticing the UNREADINESS of releasing something – and yet you are NOTICING there is a pattern that you previously couldn’t see. THIS IS HUGE. The universe allows you and prepares you for a release before you are ready to release. You don’t have to retraumatise yourself. When you are ready, you are. Before that, you aren’t. You can know when that is happening because you will only face it once you are ready. And everything that you are facing is because you are ready and it’s the perfect timing for you to face it. You may see your patter from the corner of your eye 10, 100 times before you are meant to face it! Don’t let your toxic spiritual ego tell you that you should already be done with that. There is a natural unfolding of your patterns in order to take you through a journey of maximum transformation, and some patterns come before others.
- Use each process to sensitise yourself with your own higher intelligence – you as an abstract being in a higher dimensional plane are teaching yourself how to become the truth of yourself – which will be different than mine – and that’s the reason I don’t give a prescription but keep the edges of your opening within a framework so you can learn to distinguish your own edges and develop your own gifts from there.
- Accept that this is part of how you teach yourself – and any resistance to it will show trauma within yourself – only when you truly accept reality as it is – and in this case, to clear as it is – you will be able to step up in your journey – true acceptance lifts everything up – let go of any expectation & learn to flow with good or bad days, with everything that is thrown at you, like giving your other cheek, and that will lift you exponentially up.
- Use every hint of resistance to go deeper. The faster and the deeper you do the work the more time you will have for your true life afterwards. The pace is up to you. How well equipped and skilled you want to be for when the big waves come and how much you’re going to let you slap your face is up to you.
- Some clearings will be conscious – some will be unconscious – accept and forgive that. Sometimes you will let some stuff come up subconsciously, or maybe it’s so deep it can only come up in that stage as something unconscious – accept it and let it go. Accepting the tides as they are and the mess they create is more relevant than that particular one challenge.
- If this path leads to the highest timeline – is it worth it? Realign yourself to a bigger WHY you are doing this – make peace with it – let it break your heart – release comparison – deflate the Ego – realise how things are is how they are meant to be because acceptance of WHAT IS is more important than the specifics of a particular clearing or emotional release of pattern deconstruction.
- Use every disturbance to realign yourself to a higher truth about yourself – to a deeper clearing – how much is worth your true self liberation? How many hours can you put for becoming a being with no trauma, free from conditioning? Light as an enlightened being? How big does the result need to be in order for you to put up with the work? It’s a clock mastery work art. Little pieces coming together into a masterpiece of transformation. How big is your project for the world?

## Feeling

The solution to everything is FEELING.

You were not able to feel the fullness of your trauma when it happened, so you disassociated, which encapsulated the trauma in your physical, mental, energetic and emotional bodies.

Feeling is messy. It can be painful. As you are going through what you repressed / supressed / numbed yourself about.

People talk about belief work, and belief cannot get you as far as feeling.

Beliefs are held together because of a feeling, or the lack of FEELING.

When your belief is that you are NOT GOOD ENOUGH, or a FAILURE, it’s not enough to flip them around to be GOOD ENOUGH or SUCCESSFUL, what you’ve got to do is access the unfelt emotions and feelings that put that belief in place, and break your heart free of that supressed emotion or feeling.

There is not only one time when something added up to your pool of NOT BEING GOOD ENOUGH, there are hundreds if not thousands. You will be working with some beliefs and wounds for many times. That’s ok. It will take time to reprogram your body, heart, and mind after 20, 30, 40, years of negative programming and trauma accumulation.

Feeling means you’ve got to find the nuance and the specific micro aspect that has a story to tell about the pain that was inflicted onto you.

Each different situation has many different aspects, dimensions of perceptions where different aspects of you got beliefs created in slight different ways and the pain was perceived in different form.

When you were stood up for the first time by the girl or boy you wanted to date, more than one trauma was created, or expanded upon (from extension to your parents and deeper ancestral and historical trauma). There were feelings of abandonment, rejection, anger, rage, shame, humiliation, disgust, it almost touched all relevant avenues.

And there were many beliefs created, you’re a failure, you are unlovable, people always abandon you, you’re ugly, you can’t count on people, when you put your heart out it will be hurt.

These wounds are like transistors, they are like trauma categorisers, they function as a conjunction of different traumas that have already been inflicted onto you individually, and yet here they conjunct in one experience.

You were already ‘abandoned’ by your mum, ‘rejected’ by your dad, experienced anger before you were born, felt shame before you were old enough to remember, etc.

When you are going to do your clearing and feeling work you will go down avenues of experiences and feelings, and you will have to go as deep as you can, knowing that there will be a natural unfolding and ending to it. The process will end by its own, from a natural form, not because you say so. Each wound knows how much you can take how often and how deep in any particular time, and it know when is the right time to pause and put an end to itself.

Saying ‘yeah it’s my mother trauma again’ is not feeling - ‘yeah it’s my feeling like a failure’ is not feeling.

Understand, you are connecting to a long lost aspect of you. This is a person. A real human. ALIVE. INSIDE OF YOU.

You are reconnecting with a part of you that is still reliving that trauma, that never left that moment in time. Trapped.

If you ever felt it was unfair people are hungry in the world, or are raped, pay attention to these aspects of yourself. This is worse than any SCI FI NIGHTMARE you’ve ever watched.

These beings, you, parts of you, reflections of you, fragments of you, in the QUANTUM, they are ALIVE, AT THIS VERY MOMENT, RELIVING WHATEVER HAPPENED TO YOU, GLUED BY THE EMOTION OR FEELING YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO COPE WITH BACK IN THE DAY.

IT’S NO JOKE.

Take it as seriously as you want. These are real human beings in constant torture, in a microscopic scale inside of you, that FORM YOU. THEY MAKE UP FOR YOU, ALL TOGETHER.

Did you ever watch Downsizing, the movie?

Not because they are small they are less of a human, requiring less of your attention and whose suffering should ‘not concern you’.

Think that again the day you are doing clearing and feeling work and you want to swipe by ‘NEXT’ or ‘SWIPE LEFT’ to a particular pattern of yours that you know has been there for a long time and has repeated multiple times. How many versions of you are trapped in time reliving the trauma that you go along the day with no more than some frustrating thoughts here or there, or while you try to empty your mind during meditation or your yoga class?

Because what comes up in your mind subconsciously means that underneath the line where you feel thoughts as thoughts and beyond that, where unresolved trauma begins to expand into becoming thoughts, you will have 10 to a 100 times more of that same subject screaming silently at you.

You won’t always have to FEEL in order to release, but it will be a good part of it, at least at the beginning. The more you FEEL the more you will sensitise, and you will be able to feel more subtle energies, like finding the trapdoor, and you will be able to release and flush out a whole pattern, emotion, feeling, trauma, tangled mess all at once, with a particular form of energy meditation and skill.

## Digging Work

How we do the feeling work is by doing digging work. We have to find what’s underneath that wound. That challenge. That issue. Go under, and under, and under, until you find the BOTTOM, or the POINT OF RELEASE. Then, automatically, almost magically, you will be lifted up like a balloon would come up the water after being pushed and repressed down, lightly, gracefully, up into the surface, for a big breath, a big rest, a little nap, and a slight spacing out, where you will barely remember what you were doing, what you were working on, and you might not even remember you were doing feeling and clearing work.

Whenever you think you’ve reached the bottom, go deeper, whenever you think that there’s nothing more, go deeper.

SERIOUSLY. THIS IS RED FLAG FOR BYPASSING.

People will reach a point of realisation, yeah, you now remember that there was a trauma based on an argument with your parents that you barely remember, or you will recover a memory from when you were a child. THAT’S NOT A RELEASE, THAT’S NOT A BOTTOM, THAT’S NOT FEELING.

WHAT, WHO, HOW, WHEN, WHERE.

These are the only questions you can ask when you do Digging Work.

What did you feel when this happened? Who made you feel that way? How did it happen? When did it happen? Where did this happen?

What was going on in your life around that event? How did you feel? Who did you hang out with? When were the times you felt the lowest? Where did you find refuge when that happened?

- What happened?
- I had an argument with my parents.
- How did you feel?
- I felt lost, misunderstood, angry.
- How did it feel to feel lost? And misunderstood? And angry?

Let’s see, this helps you understand and FEEL the unfelt feelings.

For me feeling lost may feel like I am being tortured, and for you it may feel like you have no purpose. You get me?

Even FEELINGS are subjective, so you are going to have to break down each feeling into smaller pieces, and you are going to have to get the HARD MEANING of each of them. Nothing can be subjective. Nothing can be in a grey zone.

ALL MUST BE BROKEN DOWN.

Because the issue is not the argument with their parents, or that you felt lost, misunderstood and angry. The issue lays waaaaaaay beneath this.

- I felt lost, and it felt like being torn inside out, ripened off, tortured, in a dark cage, wet, humid, isolated, abandoned, forgotten, treated like a dog, - what’s like to be treated like a dog? – only getting food when it’s interesting for the owner, starved to death, only loved when it was ideal for my parents and not when I NEEDED IT.
- How did you need to feel love?
- How did it make you feel not to have that love?

It is a thorough work. You have to exhaust all paths to the truth of the experience.

You are looking to create a BRIDGE between what your conscious MIND knows and the box where the unfelt feeling is supressed / repressed / unfelt.

This Bridge will become a new neural pathway. At the moment you repeat the trauma neural pathway, and when you are able to connect your centre, your spiritual self, your upgraded present version that’s connected to your soul, to the trauma space that was unfelt, a new neural pathway is created.

BRIDGING is very important, relevant, and essential to the work.

Sometimes you may be working with something, have a grip about what it is, and yet you are unable to find the BRIDGE that connects that knowing, belief, awareness, of the pattern, challenge, situation to change, program to break, emotional baggage to release, and yet you can’t, because you are unable to connect to the aspect of you that is ALIVE. It has been so well kept and isolated that the door that leads you to it has had the tag removed.

A lot of stillness is going to be needed. Longer processes may be required. Be patient. Sometimes feeling the NOT FEELING is the work itself. Being OK with the feeling of not being able to connect with the FEELING that you are looking for to RELEASE IT is exactly what is needed.

Imagine turbulent muddy waters. You need some time of stillness for you to begin seeing where everything is within those waters. And yes for sure when you’ve just kicked the waters you can be as angry as you want, some time of stillness is going to be required for the waters to calm and the mud to settle so you can begin to see where you have to lead your FEELING.

SPEND TIME WITH YOURSELF. BE CURIOUS.

This is about getting to know yourself. Learning to give yourself the love no one gave you, starting by listening to what you have to say from all those wounds that were inflicted upon you.

Basic Guidelines:

- Give yourself half an hour to an hour of work.
- Open space with incense, smudging, essential oils, anything that wakes up your senses
- Sit in meditation, lay down in a comfortable position, the key is to have the body fully relaxed, so it’s easy to feel the disturbances – beware not to fall asleep – there is a time for that after the clearing - the typical shavasana – yoga style
- Early in the morning on days off – time to integrate / not rush straight to work or other activities – this is ME TIME
- Meditate or still your mind for a few minutes before starting the feeling / digging / clearing work
- Bring up your list of challenges to work on / subjects you want to dig in to know the truth about / or allow the mind to bring you a subject at that particular moment that is relevant (often times this is the best way, the natural way, as who chooses what to work on is your own deeper intelligence and not you trying to control things, tho other times it’s all just fine)
- Repeat for as many times as it feels comfortable – sometimes 2,3, 4 times a day, if you feel like that’s your call, other days not
- Use this process to keep your processing in containment – other days are for noting patterns and writing down future feeling / digging / clearing processes, so the processing does not invade your waking living life

## Space Opening Questions

Space Opening questions are open ended questions that open possibilities in your reality.

How can I get through this situations with minimum suffering

How can I improve my personal relationships to something that makes me feel fulfilled and grateful?

These questions will answer themselves as you put them out in the world. The universe will answer them, in their own way, in their own time. The more you ask the question the more the universe knows you’re interested in an answer.

How can I bring more of this in my daily practice?

How does it get any better than this?

What else is possible?

All of these questions will open a future where you know the answer to them so you can APPLY them into your life.

They are great for places where you feel stuck, and though they are very beneficial at the beginning of your journey of sensitisation, they will eventually fade out, as they integrate into your subconscious (let’s say you will continue asking and the asking will be subconscious so you don’t have to constantly search for what better question that’s going to open up something in your life is like).

This is great to work with stuckness, and as I said, eventually it’s a practice that will end up fading away and you will be doing it less and less, yet it is very beneficial at the beginning as it allows you to search for what can be done instead of getting stuck in the WHY IS THIS HAPPENING and all the VICTIM mentality that blocks you and doesn’t let you look for different and new options.

How can I change this? What’s possible for me? How much can I change this whilst remaining calm?

The possibilities are endless. These questions are KEY. They can allow and bring about a lot of transformation. The more care in the questions the more transformation in your life will be.

They can be formed in a variety of ways and the more specific and heartfelt you are the further you will evolve.

Make sure questions you ask are not a YES/NO answer.

Beware not to do a question that is a statement with a question mark. How can I get what I want here? – I want to get this here – Instead of – what are my possibilities here? What is the possibility I am not seeing that if I would see it would change my life in this, that, or the other way? What am I really looking for here? What am I learning? What will bring about the most growth at the most comfortable rate here?

Be smart. Ask smart.

Questions will take their time to get answered. Don’t terrorise yourself. Things take time. Ask. Feel comfortable. Do feeling work. Ask again. Feel the questions that want to be asked, don’t ask with the mind. Ask the questions that want to be asked when they want to be asked. Don’t make it a strict routine. The questions of today are not the questions of tomorrow. Some may repeat. Many won’t.

## Clearing Meditation – Life Meditation

Allow the latest thought to come up and observe it. What is it talking about? Where is it leading towards when it’s observed?

There are two ways to do this, and most probably they will merge and intertwine.

The way it was told to me and I never did was the following:

Meditate about your life. Begin with last month, move on to the previous, and so on, to previous year, each month, each year… Until you reach childhood, and beyond childhood. Explore…

The other form is the one that seems more natural. You begin with the latest thought, and see where it leads you, may be another experience that links to this trauma, and then the next one, maybe the first jump was a few months, then many years, then a couple decades, then you feel your ancestry, your parents, or beyond that into a historical timeline into the middle age.

You may want to reflect on particular traumatic events in your life. The time you moved to another country, when you lost that partner, that group of friends, that time of crazy partying in your life, the cycling trips to work, etc.

You may feel like a month by month or year by year may work, and it’s still intertwined. If you analyse last year, it will bring about the most relevant things, in the most relevant form. You don’t have to control the timeframe or make sure that the events are sorted. Let your body do the magic of this process. Your natural healing abilities know better what’s best to work on.

The point of this meditation is you let your thought patterns (where classical meditation said you had to ignore or let them pass) and actually follow up on them. Each thought is a door to a trauma. An enlightened being would just BE, and would not THINK. It would BE, it would FEEL THE SPACE. It would at most think when it would need the tool of thinking. But It wouldn’t use a subconscious process of bringing a thought of disturbance up without reason or clear knowing of its intention there.

Each thought comes up as a compound of different trauma stored in your body and its energetic, mental and emotional parts.

Each thought is a door to your psyche, and if followed to the end, a release is assured. It will show you your life, recover your memory, uncover the truth of what happened, lead you to greater understanding, wisdom, bliss, and ultimately reconnect and expand your TRUTH.

(allowing thoughts to guide you deeper into a journey until the end of it is an emotional / energetic release)

(meditate back in time from the most recent events to the further ones, in any time frame jump as it comes, and repeat)

## Inner Constellations

All of these ‘aspects’ we’ve been speaking around can be seen as Inner Constellations. Classically, this work comes from what we call ‘parts work’ which is a form of ‘shadow work’. The idea is that inside of you are different parts, aspects, versions of yourself, and this is how we do the classical work of ‘Family Constellations’. The idea behind ‘Family Constellations’ is that other people will energetically take the role of whoever the orchestrator decides you have to take.

A milder form of that would be to do it on yourself, or with no other people, in which case you would write the constellation in a paper or target a particular chair to say ‘this chair will now carry the energy of’ and do the same as in the classical Family Constellations.

We go one step further than this. If having a paper helps, do so, if assigning a chair a role works for you, go for it.

I go for the least amount of effort, which means I do it in my own energetic space, in my mind. I allow this energy to express through, not particularly with a description of who this part is, because it doesn’t matter. You don’t have to be able to put a name on the part of you, you mostly need this part to be able to be received. This means you have to let it express and you have to be able to accept what it is that it shares.

Inside of you, you may have an aspect that wants to have sex with a person, and may be very upset for not being able to be reciprocated. Then you have an aspect which is your inner parent and it’s criticising you saying how many bad things you have done in life that lead you to be rejected, to fail there. Obviously the one who wanted to have sex was a wounded inner child. Then you have a toxic spiritual ego (most spiritual egos are toxic), which says you should be able to be cool and not have to feel anger towards the person or the situation. Then you have the repressed anger being a constellation too, feeling like it is not okay to be, itself, the anger, the emotion, the feeling, that there is no space and no one would want that part if it was to be true to itself, angry.

You can see there’s a mess here, and I’m probably leaving some aspects out of the equation. The truth will probably be messier, and when you begin to work with some of these and release them, more will bubble up as some space is freed.

You are like a computer working with lots of RAM memory and at the moment a process has finished, the RAM memory gets freed and it becomes available to the process that is requiring more memory, often times splitting such memory in relation to how much each process is asking for. This means you don’t get much of free unused RAM memory. At the moment you free some memory, some trauma, the energy will lead you to work on the next available one. This keeps your horizon free. You can only see the 10 most important things to work at this moment, so you don’t overwhelm yourself with a table full of 100s of folders full of 1000s of papers.

The challenge with this is that often times we think that we only have 10 things to work on and then ‘our life will be done, finished, things will change, go better from there, will be over, done and dusted’. HA!

No.

If I give you a list of tasks with a MILLION things in it, probably you won’t want to start. This is the same. If I tell you how much you’ve got to clear you may as well throw the towel away. The thing is that you know you don’t want to throw your towel away because you know what a life full of suffering feels like and you know that despite how much effort you’ve put into things there are some of them that hurt a lot to be having to be repeating those patterns again and again.

The challenge is going to be, and I tell you IS GOING TO BE, what I said many times before. ‘It’s too much, too long, can’t do it, takes forever, it has no ending, it doesn’t work’.

Assume there are a MILLION things you’ve got to work on. The work of a LIFETIME. Now this will be a constant flow of stuff from your subconscious to your conscious mind. This is NATURE’S way of SELF-HEALING. Your natural ability to transform and shade the past.

Every time you want ‘to be there’ it’s going to hurt. Every time you want ‘to be done’ it’s going to hurt. It’s never going to be done. Actually, if you think that it can ‘be done’ or ‘be there’, WUAH, THIS IS GONNA HURT THE MOST. I TELL YOU.

If you think that I can ‘be done’, the moment you are going to be getting close to a state of cruising in, relaxed, accomplished, mastering surfing the wave, IT’S GOING TO EXPLODE ON YOUR FACE. Because your soul won’t want to be ‘DONE’, so the part of you, your centre that lives in synergy with your soul’s purpose, the part of you that KNOWS, it will fight like CRAZY not to let you be ‘done’ because if you are ‘done’, what else you got? DIE? LEAVE YOUR BODY? These beliefs can really fuck you up for a while, and they can hurt a lot.

They are not the easiest of all to work on, yet it’s good that you are aware that these ones are there, so you don’t get so surprised when they come out, and if you are a particular kind of student, you may be able to work on these before they are knocking on your door.

Do you ever wash your teeth and think ‘oh maybe today is the last time I have to wash my teeth?’, it sounds crazy right? Why would you ever have to be completely ‘done’? Maybe if you didn’t have teeth, not a great option right?

Same with this. Energetic hygiene. Beyond daily clean-ups because of last night dreams or last weeks encounters. This is a full-on teeth cleaning, where all the accumulated tartar from 20, 30, 40 years of life now needs to be cleared.

Like an infection, that will suppurate and will release from the inside out, and having to take care of the outside wound as the inside one empties itself out as it’s coming out.

Will you be screaming at your infected cut, or ill liver, for whatever illness it has? The same for your emotional / psychic bodies, they have to be cleared out and despite it can be challenging at first, to brush your teeth in the correct way, to gag some olive or coconut oil straight after waking up, you get used to it, and it becomes easier and eventually pleasurable.

SAME HERE. PLEASE.

Get used to constant clearing. Imagine you are an air filter, you will be accumulating a lot of stuff and the clearing needs to be done weekly, if not daily. Depending how much you’ve done before you may need a good month of intense clearing continued by a weekly process and some intense daily workouts.

The more used and habitual you become with the process of becoming, clearing yourself, the easier will become, it will become a part of your subconscious, and you will be clearing. As if you had switched on a system within you that automatically takes the trash out. It’s like reaching KETOSIS, energetically, for your trauma. Reach that point and see a parallel process to your life be activated and work FOR YOU. Not YOU FOR IT.

## Dark Journaling

Dark Journaling is a very fun technique to use. I love it. It became one of my favourites as I was inviting more of the Inner Constellations ‘Parts Work’ into my life, inspired by Teal Swan.

The idea was to embody one part at a time, and let it journal everything it had to say, that way it would be integrated.

What came through was something completely different, and yet it felt very right and made a lot of sense.

The idea is that it doesn’t matter what part it is, if you repeat parts, if they are the same part or a different one, if they have a name or you can put your finger into the description about this part.

You will journal, one to two lines at a time, with a bullet point starting each list member.

It’s fairly a one liner, yet sometimes it can be extended a little bit more. Be thorough, be honest. No one else than you will ever read these lines. These lines are your liberation. They are the integration of the dark and suppressed parts of you. They are not you. They have been projected and implanted into you. They don’t mean you will become them. They don’t manifest. They mean nothing in relation to you or whoever they talk about. They are stuck versions of you. They are stuck emotions, feelings, traumas, and trauma responses.

You begin with as minimum detail as there is and you become more tight with it as it goes, when it comes.

Begin:

- I hate when couples kiss in front of me
- I hate when it rains the days I have a date
- I hate not being able to speak to the girls I like
- I hate myself for being shy
- I hate my parents for not helping me make friends
- I hate my grandparents for not caring about me being all summer indoors instead of out playing with the other children
- I hate my mum
- I hate my mum for not letting me play with the other children because she was mad at me for not listening to her when she called me to do something at home
- I hate not having had enough sex in my early twenties
- I hate that all my love relationships ended up in such disagreements
- I hate my ex Blabla for cheating on her new boyfriend with me after she cheated on me for him
- I am angry at myself for not taking responsibility for myself before now
- I resent myself for not being a better friend to Blabla
- I regret not having taken the chance to say ‘I like you’ to Blabla before it was too late

You can use other terms, like rejection, jealousy, hate, anger, rage, disgust, sad, destroyed.

In a way, you want all of your aspects to express yourself, so you can use the terminology ‘want’, as ‘I want to have sex with this person, or this many persons’ or ‘I wish I had got this job, I had got this money’, ‘I wish it was easier in this situation, or that situation’.

To ‘want’ is to ‘lack’, so anything you ‘want’ is a trauma, because you believe you don’t have it already. Use that sentence to channel more dark journaling.

You can also do conditioning, like:

- If I am successful, people are going to take it from me
- If I express myself, I will be hunted
- If I trust my intuition, I will get myself killed

Fears and general beliefs:

- Women always have a secret intention for everything they do (note the word ‘always’ here
- I am afraid of being sucked by other’s people’s energies
- I am afraid of losing control of my own sexual power

Note that here you don’t have to follow through about why is it that you have such fears, beliefs, hatreds, regrets, etc. You are curious to let these aspects of you speak for themselves, tell you their story. It’s like a snake uncoiling. Little by little the mess its going to be untangling itself. And whilst right now you don’t go deeper in some of these subjects, they will eventually find their way to the top of your consciousness, and every 20-30 lines of this you will continue previous subjects, and then they will go subconscious, and then conscious again, eventually you will find the right path to work on all of these without having to put much more effort than asking ‘what’s the next one?’

A LOT OF SHIT IS GOING TO COME OUT. You may do this practice for 20min, then leave it for an hour, then come back later. You may do it for a few weeks straight and then for a few months you won’t touch it. And then it will come back again for a few days. Like everything, it will flow, the tides will come and depending on your inner state more of one practice will be good and sometimes won’t be ideal to do it. Some people will use this a lot and some others won’t vibe with it at all.

It can also work as an Anti-Affirmations:

- I undermine my gifts
- I don’t know what success is in business
- I love closing down my body
- I love repeating the patterns my parents passed onto me
- My illness makes me inferior
- I prefer hiding who I am
- A part of me is racist

Ideally, you will combine all of these ones, you will channel what the next part wants to say, and you will become very still until you can hear it and write it down. You will allow the threads to untangle themselves from within you so they can come up to the surface and be cleared.

THESE PARTS ARE NOT YOU. BE GENTLE. LET YOUR TRAUMA EXPRESS ITSELF.

It’s all part of the world’s darkness. Don’t be ashamed for carrying these in any level you may be carrying them. There is no judgement in this world. We are all healing these and we all carry these, in more or less different levels.

Be authentic – be raw – it will be faster – don’t fight what you carry inside – don’t judge it – let it out – let it free – release yourself – lighten yourself

I have written around a 1000 of these, plus many times the exercises of writing down 100 Regrets, Rejections, Resentments, Jealousies, Hatreds, and any other word that carries a negative emotion, a destructive one.

You will float up like a balloon that has been untied. Effortlessly. Lots of weight are going to be liberated. It is a great practice, if it is your practice at all.

Sometimes this process led me to a full on emotional release, crying and clenching and squeezing my body and stretching myself. Many times it was a mental emotional process and it liberated itself without further effort.

All of this you are carrying inside. This way it can be freed without having to mix it up with other deeper or more relevant traumas. This will free up space for you to work on deeper and more relevant traumas. Expect greater things to come up. As you clean the clear garbage of your space you will begin to have more clarity and see clearly in yourself and others, seeing more of yours and other people’s shit.

It’s like cleaning your room, where there are a lot of confetti all over the place, easy to clean, and then when that’s out of the way you can truly see what damage the room really has, where are the bigger stains and where there is the broken glass and the lamp on the floor.

This will clear your mind, strengthen your vision, sensitise yourself. This will open up your prophecy and your clear knowing, your feeling will strengthen itself. You will have more of yourself available to do what you enjoy. You will be able to do the following work on yourself in a much easier and straight forward way. Things will make more sense. You will be able to cope with the waves much easier. Your mind will empty itself – it will be clearer inside – it is not like a meditation practice where you ignore each thought – here you write down each thought, each aspect of you – let it express and accept that it exists – it will 80% of the times release the full emotional load of any of the sentences you write – the others will be part of bigger processes and bigger lessons and healing / teaching purposes.

NOTE TO DARK JOURNALING

Scroll in IG and stop in everyone who triggers you. Either you hate them or you want to have sex with them. Both attraction and repulsion mean there’s a trauma within you. Work on that, look at them and discern what aspects are calling / repelling you, and write them down. Do that until you lose interest in the person.

Remember, the path to enlightenment is a path of peace and balance, not of extreme ups and downs. When you are in alignment with a person, you will feel normal. Not over or under excited about them.

## Lessons & Purpose

(this is about the fact of your natural learning is all about mastering certain aspects of life so you can teach them and unfold your own spiritual gift into the world)

(you may need to go through a lesson many times to truly learn it’s content and syllabus, so you can express it like a true master)

(what you think you are here to do is a microscopic 25% of the truth of what you are here for)

## Affirmations

Affirmations are good when they are targeting a real activation point within yourself.

Not everything is fixable with Affirmations.

Most of the times we use Affirmations whilst being disconnected from the heart, in which case they are going to not work very well.

- I am abundant
- I am free of relationships struggles

Many affirmations like this will probably NOT work, or work very little. You may very well be tapping into some TOXIC POSITIVITY and NEW AGE FLUFFY CANDY stuff than doing actual work.

Instead of writing these pieces of unusable words, you could very well doing Dark Journaling, and it would be more aligned to today’s times than being in a FLUFFY CANDY POSITIVE world.

You can repeat to yourself many times you ‘are abundant’ or ‘I am not available for challenging situations with the people I love’, and yet if you are not working with the root, this is a SYMPTON, you won’t be doing nothing.

REMEMBER, THE POINT OF THIS METHOD IS TO BECOME ACQUAINTANCE TO YOURSELF. TO BE CURIOUS. TO GET TO KNOW YOURSELF. TO CREATE A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOURSELF.

Telling yourself ‘I don’t care why you don’t feel non-abundant but I am going to be telling you again and again you are and yet I won’t listen or look to the reasons that you feel that way’ is a pretty big thing.

Affirmations work when they come from the heart, mostly in parallel with Dark Journaling, you can start a sentence with a ‘dash’ for a dark journaling and a ‘bullet point’ for an affirmation, for example, and intercalate as sometimes as you pull some dark stuff from you, you leave space for a nice little affirmational program to be inserted in that space.

Be surgical, be truthful, be authentic, be real.

- I am free of desire and attachment to abuse people
- I release all sexual projections, attachments, and imprints from the people in my life
- I am equally neutral to all human beings, animal world, plants and nature itself
- I feel and am safe everywhere I am
- I know what abundance means to me and my business and know how to attract it whatever I do
- I release all distortions between sexual energy and creative energy

Less an powerful is better than more and shallow.

I know I was a little harsh on Affirmations that don’t tick the box.

Work them out from your heart, feel truly inside, what your heart is yearning to write down and work with. Invite them into your life. They are not your Affirmation. They are a medicine that floats in space, waiting for you to pick it, decipher it. The sentence itself is a code, a symbology, for you to be able to call and invite such energy into your life.

Affirmations are a great way to complement Dark Journaling. Dark Journal, complete with Affirmations. We have spent so many years of our lives without looking at our shadows, that they need to be observed first.

Sometimes you are so upset that despite you know it’s not ‘correct’, you require an apology before you can act any other way. You have been so hurt that these parts are going to boycott you completely unless you bring them some peace by allow them to come up to light. Then there will be some space for fruitful Affirmations, and then you will be much greater.

Affirmations are not there for you to write them again and again, which some people to. For me it’s more like getting to know a part of you that instead of telling you what they are not happy with, they tell you what they would need as an energy to complement their healing and evolution. Ultimately it’s an aspect of you that needs to hear something. It doesn’t need you to hear it 100 times. It needs you to hear what these aspects need of you to call in.

## Dark Meditation

Right, if you are someone who has done other types of healing work you can probably see that most of this may fall into the category of doing ‘inner child’ work, and despite the name ‘inner child’, there are many other categories, such as ‘teen child’ or ‘young adult’ or ‘inner parents’. In this case, like I said before, it does not matter from where it comes, who exactly is it, its name or its description. What matters is that they can express themselves.

Dark Meditation is a practice as it would have been allowing the ‘inner child’ to express itself, express its repressed feelings and emotions, express itself to the perpetrator or to a safe adult that would tell of the perpetrator.

We are skipping all of that. We are adults and we understand our power and we can go straight into the juicy part that actually makes the energy flow and release.

In this practice, you will UNLEASH all your repressed emotions in your meditation space, visualisation mode wise.

This practice is for allowing all that repressed anger, grief, hatred, disgust, confusion, vengeance, jealousy, EVERYTHING, to be expressed out, in your own mind.

This will not call in such things in your life or anyone else’s life. This will not manifest anything you do. This will not change your relationships (at least not to the worst, more to the best).

Your intention is not to harm anyone. Consciously or subconsciously. Your intention is to express yourself and release the energies that haven’t been allowed to move one way or another. That is the reason this practice does not bring any change outside of you, unless it’s a good change (like the fact that you release your anger allows you to be more heart centered in front of certain kind of people). It brings positive change because you change, you become lighter, and then you can live from that new centre. You don’t take anyone out, do black magic on them, curse them, or hurt them in any way. At the most you will be cutting the negative chords and attachments you have between yourself and some of these people in your space.

All these feelings are already inside of you. All that anger, and how it would manifest in the world if you had no bounds and constrictions would already be as you will allow yourself to feel it. The thing is that you are observing different aspects, and aspects by itself can be VERY extreme, whilst you from your centre as an advocate for the rest of the aspects of you is a much milder and contained being.

- See yourself violently harming your parents
- Breaking arms, legs, cutting people in pieces, shooting at them

Allow all the anger to express itself in the form that already resides within you. The only thing you are doing is giving it a voice within a container space in your meditation space.

You may not be able to go from 0 to 100 in 1 second, and yet you will be able to build it up, little by little. You may do some Dark Journaling first, Affirmations, any other Feeling or Clearing practice, Digging, and in some moment you will feel there’s no another way than actually allowing those trauma response and repression to play out in your meditation.

DO NOT BE SHY. WHAT YOU DO IN THIS SPACE DOES NOT REPRESENT WHAT YOU TRULY FEEL ABOUT THIS PEOPLE, IF YOU LOVE THEM OR NOT, AND WILL NOT CHANGE IT. YOUR OWN SHAME AND FEAR OF EXPRESSING ITSELF IS THE FIRST ISSUE HERE, YOUR ANGER REPRESSION, BECAUSE IT’S BEEN PUNISHED FOR SO LONG. THAT IS THE VIRUS, THAT IS THE INFECTION.

- See yourself killing your partner
- Pulling them from the hair, torturing them
- Raping woman, men,

YOU HAVE TO LET GO OF ALL THE DESTRUCTION THAT ALREADY ALREADY ALREADY IS WITHIN YOU. THERE’S NO WAY OF PLAYING IT COOL AND SAY NO I’VE NEVER BEEN FRUSTRATED FOR NOT HAVING SEX WITH THIS OR THAT PERSON, NEVER I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AWESOME TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SEX WITH WHOEVER I WANT WHENEVER I WANTED, OR I WOULDN’T HAVE TAKEN THIS IF I KNEW THERE WOULD NOT BE A PERSECUTION.

You have to fulfil all your destructive fantasies.

Because you can’t imagine something that is not already there. You can’t create a future you don’t already hold within yourself. This is a scape pipe. You open the tap for all this SHIT TO COME OUT OF YOU.

Yes. This is the anger that came from your parents. Your CHILDHOOD. All those frustrating times with IDIOT parents who did the best they could and yet they were FUCKED UP AS FUCK, each on their own RELATIVE WAY.

DARKNESS IS ALREADY WITHIN US. WHAT WE DO IS SHINE LIGHT ABOVE IT. WE SHED IT BY ACCEPTING WHAT ALREADY IS. WE BRING AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING TO IT.

All those rabies you had as a child, getting super upset, slamming doors, oh, I tell you, there was a lot of this energy in it. And because there wasn’t a way to healthily channel all of this, you kept it within yourself, in each and every one of your bodily organs and cells.

YES, WE COULD DO THIS THE OLD FASHIONED WAY, LIKE AN ANGER RELEASE. YES, I COULD MAKE YOU HIT A PILLOW AND A BLANKET AND SCREAM AN BLABLABLA, WHICH IS MORE TIRING AND YOU WILL TARGET A LOT LESS JUICY SLICE.

If you meditate, you remain relaxed, calm, breathing, in your space, sitting, laying down. You allow your mind to train in vision and sensitise itself. You allow yourself to travel through your psyche and feel all kinds of energies as you become one with the process of releasing.

This method is an extension of Dark Journaling. There are some less emotionally charged things you can put words in it. And then there are some other mega emotionally CHARGED things that you can’t put words on it. You can express them violently, in whichever form they are felt, within your own safe meditation space. Your own safe playground. Where nothing comes in or out of it. Your dream world where you can indulge in whatever dark dream you ever had, projected and imprinted onto you by a very dark subconscious world we have had the opportunity to find ourselves in.

We can pretend we have no darkness and be repressed and emotionally depressurise here and there with a mildly unhappy life, with a passive aggressive comment here and there, an argument here and there, and never really be in a state of balance and inner harmony, where we feel we have got the grip of the process and now can navigate the tides of the evolution process, and feel like there are still aspects of us and our relationships that disappoint us in some superior powerful way that does not allow us to change it or have anything to do about it.

Or we can admit to ourselves we all carry these things and be courageous and brave and thorough and disciplined and work and see what the truth is underneath. How much of this crap is ancestral, genetic, carried in the toxins, pollution, passed down generation by generation? It has nothing to do with us. It would be like being in a room full of dark graffiti’s, all written in diminishing language, and be like ‘nope, I don’t see any of this in this room, nope, not my fault so I won’t admit I see this here’.

We often times lock the darkness away, in society, in jails, cover up all of this stuff, classify it, and only feed people the stuff that will emotionally detach you from your center, without showing you the emotions of the things.

News will show you the murders and accidents and make you feel like this is normal and acceptable and yet they won’t show you the emotions, the heartbreak, or anything that would make you emotionally connect to the victims of the tragedies.

When people share emotions they connect, when they share facts they separate.

Whatever this proposal makes you feel as it appears in your space, that’s what you’ve got to work first.

- This is wrong
- This is unethical
- This is evilist
- These guys are monstrous
- These guys are mentally insane
- These guys are rapist

Everything you reject you desire in some part. Everything that is not in alignment either attracts you or repels you.

If you feel torn apart by rape, murder, governments, rich people, is that in some level there is an aspect you feel attracted towards, and you hate it because you can’t have it as someone else has it.

The aspect you feel attracted towards rape may be the trauma that says you can have sex whenever you want, whilst in your story you were hurt so many times by the people you wanted to but didn’t manage to have sex with. Murder may be about not being able to have expressed your feelings and emotions whilst others did and felt ‘they could punish’ the others whilst your parents or other aggressors in your life ‘left immune’ in your life. Governments can steal money or control narratives and leave immune, no responsibility. You may feel like your parents did not have to prove their ways to some higher power, and you came out wounded in respect to that. You may feel the injustice and unfairness of great groups of people who abuse their power, like other times coming up in your ancestral lineage, or at home, or at school, with some bully people. Rich people are living the life and ‘have no problems’ and ‘are responsible for climate change and for world waste, garbage, pollution, corporations, etc…

That is your medicine. Apologies for turning off the party. That is your trauma and that is what you’ve got to work on.

Ram Das said if you don’t accept the current state of the world, which means to be at peace with what is, you are rejecting life itself.

If you don’t accept the current state of CONSCIOSUNESS, in this world and the universe, you are rejecting LIFE ITSELF, its current form, in this world and this universe.

I am not saying we don’t have to act to make rape, murder, abuse, inequality, control, climate change, pollution, waste. I am saying that as long as you are triggered by it, you are contributing to the energy of it REMAINING in the planet.

Only that which SLIPS off you, you will be letting go of. What SLIPS you will not feed off you in order to exist in this universe. LET GO of everything that triggers you. If IT TRIGGERS YOU, YOU’VE GOT TO WORK WITH IT. YOU’VE GOT TO WORK WITH IT. YOU’VE GOT TO WORK WITH IT AND RELEASE IT.

Take some time and make sure the biggest more common subjects are dealt with, one way or another, to a certain level. This will contribute to the whole beingness of you. It will contribute to your abundance, your success, your psychic skills and abilities, your personal transformation, your relationships, your love life, EVERYTHING.

- Torture, skin off, stab
- Knives, spears, guns, fire
- Cremate, which style
- Blow up buildings, execute people
- Choke, drown,

Accumulated anger, hatred, the kind that makes your liver, stomach and intestines ill as they probably all of ours are, is a very heavy and dense energy, and it’s manifesting form I the energy realm is this one I am sharing with you.

Make your own horror movie in your mind and rest assured it will be safe for everyone.

Take your POWER and FREE from what’s BEEN DONE TO YOU, YOUR CHILDREN, YOUR ANCESTORS.

IT IS THE WORLD’S PAIN AND DARKNESS, NOT YOURS.

YOU ARE THE TRANSMUTTER.

YOU ARE THE BRAVE CORAGEOUS BEING WHO IS NOT SCARED TO LOOK WITHIN AND SAY HEY I SEE YOU HURT HERE AND I WON’T BE LOOKING AWAY AND MAKE LOOK LIKE I DON’T KNOW YOU ARE HERE.

DO THE WORK OTHERS ARE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH TO DO.

DO THE WORK YOU KNOW IT’S RIGHT FOR THE WORLD.

BECOME AWARE OF THE TRUTH OF YOURSELF AND THE WORLD, AND BRING THAT NEW LIGHT OUT INTO THE WORLD.

When you do this, you will begin to see more beneath people’s truths, you will see where they hurt, what they lie themselves and you about, everything. You will become X-Ray glasses and everywhere you look you will be NEO from THE MATRIX. You will see through the codes, the programming, into the truth of reality and EXISTENCE.

## Light Meditation

The difference between the Dark Meditation and the Light Meditation is the intention behind it. In the Dark Meditation you are looking to release your negative emotions by ‘punishing’ or ‘hurting’ others. It has a harming release form of depressurising. The Light Meditation is the contrary.

In the Light Meditation we will be working with indulging the being because it feels ‘good’ to do those actions. The difference in rape, for example, will be than in the Dark Meditation you’d be doing it as a form of hurting, whilst here you’d do it because being able to have sex with that person in that form would feel nourishing for you.

This doesn’t mean in this meditation there may or may not be something like that. Here you may imagine all those people who you’d wanted to have sexual relationships with accept you and give you that, have your fantasies come true, from an intention of indulging and nourishing yourself because in this dream world all the dreams are coming true.

Under any circumstance, what you do in this space appears to be ‘negative’ to the people you do it with. There is no negative leftover. Even if you are a King or a Queen, and are subordinating people, and you make them do what you want, the energy can’t be of the hurt you are causing them but of the superiority and how it feels to be able to have that power, freedom, omnipotence over the rest of the world and the universe. The goal of this practice is to have fun, to get turned on, excited, to dribble saliva, to get your jaw down to the floor.

This is a meditation to see unfold if every wish you ever had in terms of something ‘good’ for you, without ‘harming’ others, would have looked like. It’s like the idea of waking up lucid in your dreams and be able to indulge in any sensorial experience of your choice, instead of using it to make the dream a nightmare for the other dream figures. Here you barely find resistance from others characters, as your wish is their will. Almost like they all accept your role play and they don’t feel anywhere close to tell you the safe word to tap out of it. They love it.

- See yourself with the car, the house, the ideal wife or husband
- Experience it, feel it, how good it would feel, feel the nourishment coming up through your body
- See yourself experiencing the pool, the people around you, the appreciation, admiration, that you yearn
- The success, the fame, the distinct treatment
- The pleasure of sexual relationships in any form it pleases so, and as it changes
- The small moment, small details, relationship with your children, your parents, lost moments, recover your childhood classroom, make it loving this time, reconnect with the people you couldn’t in the deepest way you always wanted, love and let be loved
- Do sports, extreme sports, have a healthy physical body, great psychic skills, magic abilities, fly, teleport, make the world a supernatural playground
- Taste all types of foods, have people serve you, have people fan you
- Live in different times and epochs, be in the pyramids, drink wine, be adored, be prayed upon
- Experience any sci-fi or fantasy role, experience Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, or any other story, book, cartoon, imaginative world

Give yourself any fantastic experience you need in order to heal. This is a beautiful form to heal. Give yourself the medicine you need in order to heal. Spending time with the ‘elements’ that would heal your psyche and emotional bodies is a gift. This goes from experiencing the vibration of a colour, or a sound, to a whole full-on sensorial experience.

Some people call this Reality Shifting. Where they ‘shift’ their reality to one of their own choice.

Despite that you may be able to truly ‘shift’ your reality to one of your choice, the meditative space will attract the healing frequencies you require, by your act of wishing, visualising, and vibrating with it.

Some would say you can truly shift, and we do it constantly, now the closest realities to the current one are probably going to be the easier ones to shift towards, as you learn to trust and believe your power and break down the nature of reality. It takes great power to constantly shift reality towards one of highest frequency, and yet we do it constantly. It’s about how to sustain the change.

This is what we are doing in this manual. More of that.

Be full of yourself, feel accomplished, supreme, elevated, divine, godly, powerful, all mighty, transcendent, enlightened, all master of the universe.

The idea is that you allow all the constricted parts of you that were wounded by ‘realism’ about the world to have their slice of cake.

In an ideal society, an enlightened society, you’d be 100% fulfilled. To be there, you’ve got to begin to fulfil yourself, and what best than your own meditation safe space to do that.

The sooner you fulfil your inner desires the sooner you’ll manifest the ideal life for you.

NOTE

That your wounded aspects of you wish and dream about certain unrealistic goals or lifestyle, does not mean that once you clear this you will still want such life. When you clear your deepest darkest and lightest dream desires, sexual, control, power, it does not mean that as you progress in your work, your life will manifest as such.

What you are doing is clearing the space from projections, wounds, patterns, programming, imprints, that don’t allow you to see the truth about yourself and the life that you TRULY desire.

Once you release the aspects of you that are OVERCOMPENSATING you will begin to see your true way of life.

Let’s put it this way. If you have starved to death for 40 days, you may approach eating food again like a pig, indulging in changing flavours, not chewing properly, swallowing down, not being ideal for your digestion.

That’s the same. When you have starved for so long, let yourself get it the way you want, reach balance, harmony, and then begin rewriting the rest of your life, from a place of fulness, not scarcity, and have a nourishing healthy diet. Your habits will be different when you have starved for many days than when you come from a full stomach.

Same is with money. Have not money, get money, quickly spend money. Have a lot of money, know money, manage money, generate more money.

Rich dad, poor dad.

Let go of all the extreme aspects of you, find your centre, live from it, by it.

You are not the person you think you are.

You live by generated rules, aspects and conditions that do not mirror the truth of your soul and heart.

Most of the times, the Ego will say that you like this or like that, and you, your inner sense of self, will fear that that may be true, and you will block yourself from moving forwards.

The Ego will give you the worst prognostic, in a form of a fear, with its intention being for you not to move, not to change.

It will give you your worst nightmare as a ‘solution’ in order to keep you in the same place.

Anything radical in your space will come from your heart and soul, it will come from the Ego, or any other disturbances in your energy field, to cause fear and to keep you from releasing whatever you are working on, in basis that then this fear or nightmare you are afraid of would come to truth.

- If I release my sexual trauma, I will want to have sex with my same gender
- If I empower myself, I will not care about others
- If I forgive my mother, I will have to go and live with her and take care of her
- To overcome this fear, I have to humiliate myself in front of others and I must tell them about the most horrible parts of mine in the most horrible way
- If I serve people wholeheartedly, I will give my life away

Often times, when extreme responses come to a ‘release’, it comes from the Ego, extreme responses are sign of a mild psychotic energy.

If you were to force yourself out of the trauma you are working with, you would be ‘absorbed’ by the other energy.

If you push yourself out of a trauma without integrating it, you will inevitably become the energy fear you held about it.

- If I let go of this I will get enlightened
- If I let go of this I will be done

You can’t reach enlightenment by releasing something, and you can’t be ‘done’ with shadow work.

The energies on the other side of believing you would be enlightenment is a mild psychotic state. They feel like a swirl of energy and a ‘cu-cu’ feeling, often times accompanied by a very dark murdering energy as your worst desires and feelings will come up to express themselves.

- I can murder people
- I can rape people
- I own people
- Whatever definition of insanity you have will be personified here

What to do here?

Notice when this edges, extremes, come out, they will repeat, when working on similar and also different subjects. Notice them and become still. Feel the uncomfortability without having to cross the border.

There is an uncomfortability of acceptance of possibility.

A complete closing down towards the possibility that any of this could be true.

It is so intense, our worst fear, like the worst rejection we could ever do, by fear of being ‘infected’ ourselves.

This is very typical from middle age church, a complete vertical closing down to hear, with an extreme fear of having it yourself and therefor punish, kill, humiliate yourself as such reactions were so present back then.

Almost as if you even consider the possibility that that is within you, you must self-mutilate, throw stones at, yourself.

Your energy body is stretching here, and the idea is that you stay with these energies for as long as possible, as it seems comfortable with.

The idea is to get used to the uncomfortability that these edges bring about, without having to cross to the other side.

This allows your system to get used to these energies and create receptors for such emotions you have barely felt in your life.

## Frequency Meditations

### Energetic Alignment Meditation

This practice is like watering a plant, the difference being that you are the plant, and are compartmented into different buckets with a soil that requires a different type of water.

You can meditate in:

- Abundance
- Success
- Joy
- Courage
- Discipline
- Acceptance
- Commitment
- Creativity
- Determination
- Love

And you can also be more abstract, in a more visualitative way:

- Positive Light
- White Light
- Uplifting Energy
- High Activating Light
- Awakening Light

Use your imagination.

You can align yourself to any virtue you would like. Any that calls your attention. Check online for a complete list and pick whatever that stands out.

See yourself surrounded by the energy, encompassed, with its light, frequency, vibration and potentially colour.

See this energy clearing you, filling every space within you, every cell, every cloud of darkness you may see within yourself.

Let your intuition guide you, trust in what you see.

You may see:

- A cloud of energy in a particular part of your body
- A dark spot in your energy system
- A numb body part
- A thought form in your aura

The idea is to stay for as long as possible in each of these, allowing the energy that is being cleansed to remain bathed with the energy you are working with.

You may be guided to shift from one energy to another one, in order to make one of these dark spots shift or release its destructive energy.

Trust in your intuition. If you think you are making it up, most probably you are not. What happens is that your own fear to be right and to know the truth may block you.

Staying with the energies will dissolve the fear of knowing and work on the blockage you are dealing with.

This is a more Reiki or hands-on clearing meditation you are doing.

### Ancestral Meditation & People Meditation

The same way we have used virtues or abstract concepts, we can use people.

In your life, you may need more of your father energy, your mother energy, your sister, brother, nice, uncle, grandfather, or anyone else you may come up with.

It could be:

- Your ex-partner
- Your childhood friend you stopped talking when you were 10, 15, or any other later age
- A girl you liked and never spoke to
- The boy you had an argument with and never spoke to anymore
- A teacher
- A historical figure
- Any ancestor, known or unknown
- A deceased familiar

The idea is that some aspects of you did not have enough of these people, you are intending to fill up the cup of the space they left within you.

As per so, you may need to repeat this multiple times, in whichever times the soil has become dry on these people’s buckets. Like soil, it may need more water more often, and so each aspect of you needs to be watered with their energy, whenever it’s necessary.

The meditation may lead you to particular experiences with these people, and you may proceed to a clearing journey if it needs to.

The aspect will choose what age the person you are calling in is in your meditation. And it also may not have an age at all.

It could be that you require more time with your younger dad, from when you were a child, and even with your younger dad, despite you weren’t born when he was that age.

You may follow up the ancestry line to previous generations, to whoever gender it leads, and to both genders, if required.

You may be prompted with their story, the memory of their lives, their life choices, struggles, trauma history, and beyond.

Follow up as long as there is no strain in your meditation. Do not force yourself.

Whenever it stops being fun, you are looking at the ‘wrong’ place.

Note that you are not connecting to their physical self on those times.

You are connecting to their soul, the light of their hearts, before it is filtered by the ego into dysfunctional patterns and toxic behaviours.

### Elemental Meditation

A step further from these meditations, are elemental meditations.

Here you may follow up with:

- A particular element, like earth, water, fire, air, wood, shell, metal, etc
- A colour
- Sound, like flute, guitar, singing, a particular song, soundtrack, that calls your attention (breakup songs are one type for example, or songs that make you feel uplifted, empowered, heartbroken, if they feel good in the heart, is that they are teaching you something)
- Scent, a particular smell, flowers, essential oils, or anything that feels filling up your system
- A particular food, dish, cooked vegetable, and even meat, if such brings comfort and nourishes this aspect of you that didn’t have enough of it
- A star, constellation, celestial body
- A body organ, healthy
- A chakra or energy system
- A landscape, nature spot
- A location, city, house, transport, vehicle, building
- A book
- An abstraction of a category of a person or profession (monk, shepherd, fighter)
- An art (kung fu, painting, drawing, sculpture, tailoring)
- Sport (football, skiing, skydiving, scuba diving)
- A historical event

The possibilities are endless.

Anything and everything goes.

Many may not work for you, and some may be very healing for you.

Don’t question how is it that you may need one of these, and simply follow up with it. It will feel like having a cold glass of water in a very hot and dry day.

### Sound / Music Meditation

The sound of rain, ocean waves, birds singing, wind through the trees branches.

Piano song.

Your mission is not to understand the reason of that being as it is. Your mission is to locate what energy you are missing and bring it into your space.

## Energy Release Meditations

### Dance Meditation

Allow yourself to follow up with a thought, emotion, feeling, or idea of what needs to be cleared, and begin to bring your awareness to your body.

Let your body move, stretch, and shake and dance in whichever form it is needed. Your dance is a key into letting whatever you are carrying go.

Be very still. Allow it to flow through you slowly.

Do not hurry yourself into what you already know.

Let your body move as it needs to, let it become an art. Express yourself through your body into what your body needs in order to release what you’re working on.

Let your body show you how the movement is a tunnel into an energy and find it’s pipe in order to release it.

### Sound Meditation

Allow it to release through sound if it needs to.

To find what body part wants to speak and express it through your voice.

There are a few ways to do this:

- A sight
- A long AAAAAH, in whatever tone or pitch it comes, following the thread to the body part that is releasing, staying connected to your body, so it sings the song that it’s looking to express
- A song, with its own up and downs and verses and chorus, if it gets to do so
- A succession of different sounds, tones, unintelligible words, gibberish, beatbox, etc
- Light language, insect language
- Percussion with your body and hands

A way to do this is connecting to whatever needs to be released and allow it to tell you its story, in its own way of expressing itself.

It can be as random and childish to a specific and harmonious way.

Allow to be guided and do not go all blow up straight away. Screaming or shouting may come up, and yet it is like the high of a song, there are many tones, and oversaturating the flow of energy is not recommended.

Let the different flavours and tones to lead you to wherever you have to, and if intensity rises allow yourself to remain connected to your body, sometimes blowing up during this practice is pushing yourself through the edge, and you may find more release when remaining within a threshold.

### Symbols / Drawing Meditation

The same way you do the Dance Meditation, allow yourself to do the same with a pen and paper, and if called to, paint and brush.

It can be journaling, allowing the previous dark/light meditations we have spoken, and also it can be drawing, faces, frames, situations, etc.

The same as with sounds, it can become a form of a Light Language, allow it to become symbols, sigils, or any other form that transforms what you are going through into the paper.

You may be writing down what the release is, or the medicine to it.

### Intuitive Follow Up Thread Meditation

Eventually you will sensitise yourself. You will become aware of the energy thread that is behind each release, and you will transcend the physicality to it.

From that point onwards, a meditation may take any form.

Follow up with a thought, feeling, emotion, person, hurt, wound, betrayal, experience, anything that comes up through your intuition to work on, that you finally are able to grasp into your awareness and conscious mind.

Let it become a dance within your energetic space, like a spiralling energy, colour, and into your body, to express through movement, dance, singing, stretching, expressing, the fullness of it.

It is a portal to the depths of yourself and it becomes an art as it comes out of you.

Let yourself find in what way you yearn to express. You may find a gift within yourself here.

You may find an aspect of you that’s long lost and you have not realised you yearn to include into your daily practice and life.

You may want to become a performer, dancer, storyteller, singer, writer, painter, drawer, musician, percussionist, beatboxer, etc.

This may be an awakening of your soul’s purpose and its own way of expressing itself.

### Vibration / Shaking / Hand Movements Meditation

A close relative from dancing and writing symbols are hand symbols.

They are a combination, of body movement with a particular emphasis on hand expression.

Like written symbols, hands symbols are very if not the most powerful form of energy transformation.

Hands are a big crossing of many energy lines and are a focus of energy movement.

As in any hands-on classical form of energy healing, hands are used.

In this case, the idea is to bring that etheric feeling to these clearings, to following the thread, and to allow the hands to express the energy as it’s supposed to be healed.

Allow the vibrations to come to you, the shaking, the jerks and twitches to come to you.

Allow the energy to be transferred into the hands, and allow them to move around the space around you, in your body or the energetic space of anything that transcends space.

I can be working with you across the room. I do not need to be next to you and definitely not touching you.

Your energy field lives within the quantum field, and as I connect astrally and ethereally, I reach these within the palm of my hands, as it crosses layers of dimensions.

As you follow your thoughts or your energy threads, you will become aware that the hand movements and symbols change, and what they do may be correlating to how you feel inside, and as energy releases you or you find deeper and darker parts of you, may feel nausea, or feel hurt, or slightly disgusted by what you feel. It’s not a overwhelming feeling, it’s more like a play. Playing along with what you find.

If you find something old, it may smell, so you may feel like your face expresses that it is smelly, and you feel cramped by it.

If you see something ugly, even though you may not see it, per se, may mostly feel it, without feeling it strong, you may clench your eyes, and make a face, of contracting, disgusted, etc.

NOTE ON ENERGY RELEASE MEDITATIONS

Continue for as long as it feels curious and fun, and not when it becomes straining or obsessive.

Whatever you feel and how much you enjoy these meditations, they come and go as they please, as they stretch your energy bodies and some time off them may be required.

# Day 3

## The double edge sword of asking WHY

(why is a victim question, as it only allows for subjective answers)

(it’s great for digging the worst emotions, as subjective is probably what will give the worst projections of your feelings and wounds)

(why gives you the deepest trauma of an issue)

## Tricks & Tips

- Stare at the same point and see if the thread you follow moves your eyes from the centre point you are staring at. If it does, you know you are following the ‘wrong’ thread.
- Pay attention to any body jerks during any form of clearing meditation.
- Let subtle bodily disturbances teach you what you’re looking for.
- Not scratching, nail picking, not peeing, being hungry, being thirsty, feeling uncomfortable during the clearing meditations will contain you and tighten you to the breakthrough, teaching and opening up the clearing itself.
- That which you are meant to remember you will remember when you are meant to. What is not needed will go to the subconscious mind and will live happily there, no need to force yourself to remember what you’ve been working on.
- When a pattern disappears from the mind or is hard to keep in the conscious mind it probably means you’ve ended working with it (at least for now) and it means you are free to move on or end the clearing session.
- If it triggers you, there is something for you. If it slicks you, it has nothing for you (at least, at that moment).

## Anchoring

(Validate yourself, confirm yourself & journal it)

- Make a list for every sign you get that confirms or validates something you were asking about or were working towards
- Journal about any big breakthrough, reflections, revelations, that hold a special meaning for you
- This serves you as Anchoring – It’s like a videogame saving point. If you fall down a bridge or are taken down by an enemy energy, you get to restart from the previous saving point – not like in the old games where you had to begin straight from the beginning of the game – WHICH MADE IT VERY DAMN CHALLENGING and most people could not enjoy the game or became obsessive game players.
- Anchoring is vital – the days you are down the mind will tell you 1000 excuses why you’re on the wrong path and how nothing makes sense and how God wants you bad & the Universe does not exist as you thought you exist and BASICALLY INVALIDATE every other work and step forward you’ve ever made. Anchoring will allow you to see that a bad day is mostly controlled by the mind and you don’t have to let it pull you all the way down. It is very important. When this becomes part of the subconscious you can be going through hell outside and know it’s a passing cloud and the inner centre be totally calm knowing it’s meant to teach you something and it’s no more than mastery work or another initiation for you to raise higher, and never something that’s FINAL and BAD.

## YOUR OWN INNER COMPASS - FOLLOW WHAT FEELS RIGHT

Only do and follow up with what FEELS RIGHT – if you don’t know what FEELS RIGHT imagine what’s a 100% yes, which for me is ICECREAM, ICECREAM is a 100% yes. Follow up with that. Anything that is not a 100% yes it will create more harm than good. Anything that is not a 100% yes is most usable by focusing on what doesn’t let it be a 100% yes and work on that. In another note, you also don’t require to know why something DOES NOT FEEL RIGHT. YOU DON’T NEED TO EXCUSE WHY HAVING SEX WITH SOMEONE DOES NOT FEEL RIGHT. YOU ACCEPT IT AND MOVE ON FROM IT. DON’T GIVE EXCUSES OR JUSTIFY WHY SOMETHING DOES NOT FEEL RIGHT. Following what feels right will ultimately become your highest compass, as your higher self or spirit will guide you from that point onwards with the sense of what feels right, and following through will bring about lots of shadow and darkness from yourself and others, and if you are the one who sticks to it and become disciplined, you will become pure medicine for yourself and those around you and will evolve exponentially, becoming your own teacher and guide, and won’t need almost anything else from anyone else.

## Future Master Self & Aligning Timelines

## Time Portals & Knowing you were always there in your path

## Ideally, what would you like it to happen?

## Delay your choices for as long as possible

(until choices become an action of their own, through your beingness)

## Many events are to raise awareness, to prepare you and for you to ready yourself, they aren’t missed opportunities

(until you are aware you can’t change, many times you are showed a pattern again and again so you ready yourself and become fully conscious of what’s happening (in a microcosm way), and yet you may try to judge yourself because your mind is telling you it’s a missed opportunity or that you are not good enough to do the things you thought you were going to.)

(you wake up many times in the middle of the night to end up circling around in bed, and then think you could have used it to write or meditate -> the time comes when you wake up and you clearly know what to do)

## You may have more time off than you think. Enjoy the time off. When the time is right, you will do what you have set yourself to do. You may need less than you think and in a different form than you think

(Playing videogames and watching movies to soothe your nervous system and suddenly stand up and write 20 pages of your book, what is meant for you will happen, when it’s meant for you. Your higher intelligence knows more, you may need a particular cell balance, a particular time of the day, energetics of the city, environment, cosmic flow, sugar level, stress level)

(you are 1000 people inside of you, and you need the perfect alignment for the machine to work. Trust when you take care of yourself and do what you FEEL you are guided and when your FEELING leads you to your work, personal practice, social relationships, zone out time, it will be for the RIGHT reason. STOP BEING SO MASCULINE)

## The unfolding of your highest timeline has nothing to do with anything you can imagine. Lower timelines have a lot more effort and struggle and restlessness than what you think.

(higher timeline means right effort for the right reason at the right time, minimum effort to maximise results)

(it means ‘just’ right, wouldn’t you ideally trust that you can have lots of time to relax or to believe ‘you are lazy’ whilst you are actually accumulating energy to deliver what is yours?)

(find the reason that turns you on that explain why you act like you act)

## Ideally, you want your life to become effortless, and for that you have to make sure your whole microcosm is in alignment with the reality you want the world to be in

(the more you align with the reality where no matter what you do you cannot fail, everything comes in the right time, for the right reason, where you have lots of rest, and you cannot avoid doing what you truly want, because you will not miss it, you will be in right time, things unfold in the form that turns your soul on, which is when the ego drops and what your heart yearns, )

(the rest will be ego resistances to accept such reality and lots of patterns and programs will come up saying it’s not possible, it’s laziness, it’s not ok, it’s not moral, it’s not scientific, it’s bypassing, -> it is bending reality to your favour -> it is aligning to the reality, multiverse world that works best for you -> this one requires less effort, as it requires to not overdo, to trust, surrender, to find the point of balance and know it will be the best possible life for you, in better ways you could ever imagine)

(you may struggle to relax when things begin to become what you dreamt, with people wanting to help, and you only doing what you love, and someone willing to do what you wouldn’t, and having to relax in that place and accept the gift the universe is giving you, barely realising you DESERVE IT)
