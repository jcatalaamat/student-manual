# Connecting to the self-transformation movement

- Tune into the consciousness of the transformation everyone is going thru and command it all to become part of you. On the day of today I find god to transform us with its love and light. You're only an extensions of all of it so you are receiving all of it

# Expanding Meditation

What you need to do is empty your mind. Then, you imagine expanding out into the space where you are and begin to visualise everything that is there, the furniture, the other people, the walls, the floor. You move out of your space into the further space, into the universe, and see all the stars, the galaxies, all the way into the fabric of it. You go through the fabric into the realm of space. 

Expanding into the mountains, the oceans, the whole world, becoming one with the planet. 

You expand inwards. Into the fabric of the atoms and quarks and the particles of light, to the realm in between space, the space between each particle is the same in every person, inanimate object, everything that is. This is your essence, and your essence makes up of the whole universe. It is only the organisation and the vibration of these essential particles that forms a different form on the outside, in the inside, we're all the same, we're all light.

Then you imagine you expand into the person's you're trying to connect to, you see yourself crossing the space between you and them, at the speed of light. 

# Routine Practices

- HEART SONG - RELEASE A LOT OF RESENTMENT AND SORROW, WILL GET YOU AHEAD OF YOURSELF QUICKLY 2x month
- The practice of the Self. You practice who you are. You become connected to that which is Source.
- Go up to the Creator every morning and every evening. Command to clean your energies and to align you to the best version of who you be. Then ask the questions to the universe, being curious of what the answer could be. Make it FUN!
- Connect to 1 ancestor and receive guidance and love
- Go to your Theta Space, your spiritual workshop where you access all of the psychic awareness through the connection to All That Is.
- Celebrate each accomplishment. Cleaning the table, brushing your teeth. Everything you do every day is an accomplishment
- Challenge yourself - What would it be like to have interest in getting my body stronger? What would it be like to actually take the time to train my physical form every day? How much fun could it be? What would it take to still be at ease and turn out to be any better that I could have ever imagined?
- What is a small daily action I can take that will give the most powerful results in my life and being able to keep my word with myself? What would it take to always be able to choose without indecision? To always know at every step what is the action that will empower me and have the necessary will to take that step? How much fun would that be? What would the first step be?
- Anything that doesn't allow that to show up, would I now destroy and uncreate?
- Pray for the loved ones in your Life. Pray for where you come from. Your parents. Send them Love. Send Love to the people you love. Love in your prays. Spend 5 minutes doing this
- Make it FUN! Do a connecting act of less than 1 minute to remind you of who you are. Stretch every time you go to pee.
- Keep your environment nice. By cleaning the physical and doing it as an extension of you, cleaning the inside will fall into place by transmission.
