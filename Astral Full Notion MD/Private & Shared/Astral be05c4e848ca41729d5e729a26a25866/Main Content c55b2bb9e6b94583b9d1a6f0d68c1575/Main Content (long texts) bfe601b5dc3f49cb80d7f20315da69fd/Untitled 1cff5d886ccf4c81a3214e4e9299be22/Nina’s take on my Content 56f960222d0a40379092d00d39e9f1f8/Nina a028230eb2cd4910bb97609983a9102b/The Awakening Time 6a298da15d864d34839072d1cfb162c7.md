# The Awakening Time

# How I found God for the first time

In each and every class I have attended I have learnt something unique. Basic level was a complete radical uplift in my life. I had been having experiences with God for almost a year, but had no strong psychic awareness or realised much about it. I did Reiki and Opening Psychic Awareness Meditation training 2 months before I found Theta, and it showed me different ways I could use my third eye, with the guidance of my beautiful teacher Sera Shivnan (aka @IGMention).

After Reiki, I went one day onto a very deep meditation where I found my heart and when I faced my deepest fears (and yet to know, limiting beliefs) and released with love, I realised I had always been spiritual. I realised how long I had gone asleep by buying into everyone else's perceptions. That day, and it still waters my eyes to feel into it, I found my Truth, and that was that whatever I chose to belief, I could, and it would be real for me. And that it did not matter what my best friend thought or what my parents would think. How could I be so ashamed of loving God? How could I be so ashamed of loving myself? It wasn't an easy meditation, I was faced to fears and doubts about myself and my life and what would I become if I was to embrace who I wanted to be. As I directed love into it and dig all the way to the bottom issue, I began disappearing into this infinite expansion from my heart and left my body. I then found myself only coming back to my body having forgotten what I was doing, almost paralysed in bliss, not grasping what was I doing there.  Then, I would face more fears or doubts or would straightly realise it again and disappearing once more in an ocean of ecstasy.

It's been over a year from that experience now, and my life has drastically changed. It did not drastically change from 600h of Yoga Teachers Trainings or long mindfulness meditations. It did not change from reading eastern philosophy or attending transformational coaches events.

It was not that evening that changed, but the year that came after it. The journey with Theta Healing and what it opened and reminded of what I am capable of when connected to my True Nature.

A month after this experience, I found Theta Healing through a beautiful soul that had just come into my life, that was living from her heart. She never gave me a session, nor told me much about it. She said it was a technique in which you could easily shift subconscious beliefs and empower yourself through the energy of that which I had just realised in experience. I trusted her blindly and to my pleasement, there was a course with her teachers starting in less than 2 weeks. And I'm speaking about the pandemic about to blow up on our faces. I managed to attend the Basic level just when London was going into first lockdown. Second training was delayed to more than 4 months. I want to cry when I say this. That long weekend, those 3 days. It liberated me. It showed me a way out of the pain, of the victimism, of the unworthiness, and it became a bridge onto empowerment and Truth. Life became a playful and exciting experience. I will never forget my first day of Basic DNA. When my teacher gave us our first exercise, It all connected with the experience I had just had on my own. The mind state, the fears, the doubts, the heart opening, the Theta state. It all was there. I was being explained what I had just experienced. It blew my mind. And the best of it? I could literally trigger the same things, again and again, at my will!

It was like being a child again playing with Lego. I could create my own world and live by it. I could live in the theta state where children are when they play imagination, creating their reality as they are. And to think that that state was God, that it was our Nature, our True Nature, indescriptible to experience. I felt like I was finally in Hogwarts, and all those years as a kid waiting for someone to come and say 'yes son, you are not a muggle, you actually can do magic, just that not everyone else realises it'. It killed me. It completely destroyed my Ego. All those years of depression because I did not want to live in a world with so much lacking. All those years trying to cover up my depression for being separated from my True Essence. There was a way to make magic, and most adults ignored it. Most people decided they did prefer to live in a world where there was no magic. But for me, oh, it was like someone finally came along and said 'sorry for making you wait, sorry someone did not tell you this before, sorry you had to wait for so long, but this is actually home, this is actually what you're made of'. 

~~It was like seeing home around the corner. Now I knew where I was, what street I was in, and suddenly the whole perspective about what city I was in came in, so information flooded my mind as I was remembering other streets from that same city, and the local bars and businesses. I knew where the train station was just because I realised where home was.~~

And it felt so unfair that they took it from me for 30 years. 30 years being lied saying 'you can't do anything about it, you have limitations, that is impossible, you are weak and to the mercy of your weakness and others and cannot change anything about it'.

The most important thing here is that someone told me how, and that I got proof of it. You know when you ask well I will believed when I can see it? That's what I got. My version of it. My previous experience got me my power of belief as I released fears around being rejected by my loved ones if I would choose to believe in magic. When I decided to believe and follow thru, then I got my proof. I could connect to the divine source energy and ask for something to ocurr, and it would, and I would feel it, as instant as I would ask for it to happen. Having someone already being there and telling you how, it definitely helped onto being acknlowledged and reassured that I am not going nuts. It is very easy. I asked myself that realisation night. If I can choose between living a world with magic or one without it, what would I choose?

~~What if all was made of magic and maths and science were just grasping to describe it in its own way?~~

I am a magical being. The mere act of existence is already magic for me. And our bodies? Our brains? Our consciousness? Isn't that magic? How if we could even do more than that? What if we were beings of much more potential than what we thought it was possible? What if all was made of magic? Wouldn't that be much more fun than a reality where things are as they are and can't change? You can't alter things as much as you'd like?

# The Awakening

I had awakened years earlier. It was whilst I was living on a canal boat in London. I drank a lot of wine, took recreational drugs, slept with whoever I could and wanted to, smoked a lot of daily weed. It was better if I would black out, it was better if there was a hangover. It was better if sex was included. For no reason at all. It was just my way of valuing experiences. The more the more fun it was. The more the more valuable I was. The more the more accepted I thought I was. It was my way of being, of integrating and relating with people. As if that would make me likable and lovable. Then one day I argued with my best friend from then. I was upset because his new girlfriend was around too much and so I did not get the love I wanted from him, the attention I needed for me to feel valuable. He said to me, that whatever united us in the past, it was not there in me anymore. 

~~Quite a hard thing to say to your best friend. Specially with no warning, as if it had already been in his mind long time. Maybe he realised it at that moment, as I questioned our friendship in that moment. Maybe he channeled it. LOL.~~

# What is God for me

# The Awakening Process

# What to do with the light inside of you

the light that you have inside of you has an intelligence of its own. 

# Differences between spiritual path in the past and now

The past was very slow. With small amount of information.

The present is very fast. Loads of information. Loads of souls awakening and supporting each other in a cosmic balance of synchronicities.

Even when we post on Social Media, our divine intelligence is meaning for us to support each other, so themes may be similar for everyone at the same time, and any post may be the one that anyone else needs at that point to feel empowered to release another layer of old feelings.
