(I would like to share with you what I have gone through over the past 2 years )

This is a statement of my identity and it feels like coming out of the closet.

For the past 2 years, I have been dedicated on getting to know myself deeply and becoming aware of all the places where I was not honest with myself.

What I discovered was an intertwined web of life experiences where I felt shamed, abandoned, sad, hurt, rejected, alone and afraid.

I discovered that childhood conditioning was real, that the dysfunctional educational system disempowers, that family trauma passes on from generation to generation and that there are behavioural dynamics in the socio-cultural environment that are quite harming.

I was devastated.

After the shock came the anger. I felt stuck, victim of my own suffering.

I began to recognise that I did not feel good at all and that did not know how to change it, that the story I was telling myself about myself wasn't matching the reality I was in, and that I felt powerless to the hurtful dynamics that kept repeating no matter who they were playing out with.

The anxiety, the relationship struggles, the unfulfilling friendships, the negative self-talk, the over-achieving or under-motivating career, the body shaming, the unhealthy eating disorders and the substance abuse. It all rooted in the way I had learnt to respond to the outside world.

Then, one of my most important revelations came when I realised I had a choice, to change what had happened to me and to everyone else. I understood that patterns like these occurred unknowingly and influenced us throughout society where we related to each other. My world shifted. It became a different place.

The way we learn as humans is through observation and repetition. From a very young age we absorb and learn behaviours from our surroundings. We carry these limitations from generation to generation, teaching each other ancestrally, unconsciously. 

The truth is, it was never about us.

We can choose to reclaim our untainted and un-programmed natural state of being by taking responsibility for what has happened to us and by being willing to respond differently.

When we do, we begin to have a greater sense of meaning, presence and integrity between what we think, what we speak, what we feel and how we act.

When we are aware, we act differently and accordingly in response to what we are. There is no effort in changing as there is no effort in being. 

The transformation ripples instantly and it accelerates exponentially into all areas of our life, as we become lighter and clearer, realising a deeper level of aliveness in ourselves.

For the past 4 years I have participated in more than 1000 hours in extensive and intensive training on integrative and therapeutic modalities such as Theta Healing, which I am an instructor of, Access Consciousness, and other practices such as kundalini yoga, breathwork, conscious relationships, meditation, energetic and psychic awareness.

With the strong and structured logical thinking that I developed during my 8-year career as a software engineer I felt the need to challenge the teachings I received with the most advanced scientific research on human mind.

My journey from old traditions to new-age modalities left me unsatisfied. Some tools would only get me that far, and then they would not be able to get me any further. Some modalities would disempower certain aspects of me. Some techniques would have taken eons to complete. For that reason, I had to continue to go back to the core of what I learnt, to feel within myself what did work, in what circumstances, where it didn't and what kind of challenges I were still present for me.

___________________________________________________________________________

I came to develop my own way, an awareness that allows me to feel the level of integrity of the a statement. I perceive the intertwined limiting patterns that need unknotting to unleash your full potential. I can discern between the different aspects of you. I can discern the truth of your heart from the projections of the ego-mind.

When I speak, I speak to your subconscious, reprogramming the mind and dissolving the patterns that have been running unconsciously. I bring effortlessness into your process. This way, your change comes from a place of being instead of doing. 

I ask the right questions to allow new awareness and information to flow into your mind. When we acknowledge the truth of the situation and the emotion that was never felt, it is not needed anymore.

The language we use creates our own reality. It shapes the experience in any given moment. When we speak from a place of limitation, we use words that disempower us and not allow us to free ourselves. When we speak from a place of empowerment there is no room for doubt or fear.

Your body accumulates the experiences that have created the limitations in your psyche, and remain stored in you as they await to be witnessed and acknowledged by you. They await for you to realise the truth of the story that has kept you limited .

When you realise from which aspect you are living your life, the part of you that is not true naturally dissolves, as it's witnessed and acknowledged.

We often discredit the worth of going deep into releasing the conditioning as it is not a 'major issue' in our lives as we learn to resign from changing old aspects that have hurt us and others too much, or seem to be too complicated, so we learn to live with the pain of carrying it because we fear the pain of changing would be much greater. That is not true. Accumulating clear or subtle conditioning will penalise us on the long term. Subtle conditioning will infiltrate deeper into our lives and will make us more rigid on the long term.

Further than this. We attract situations that will resemble that which made us be stuck on the first place in order for us to be able to realise them, acknowledge them and release them.

As I have learnt to experience this process, it's not a burden or an obsession to transform, but a natural and innate ability we hold. So it is a matter of when to change, and not if to change. As long as we turn our backs to this innate ability, we will keep finding the same challenges over and over in similar situations and with different people.

So Â In my experience, the sooner the easier, the better. It has a natural rhythm.

I act as a depressuriser, as you find the key of what happened and how a pattern was created, I become the pipeline in which the stuck energy leaves you. I feel the reprogramming occurring in these moments, It is a very subtle way of transforming the energies that have been stuck for a long time.

When the shift happens, we naturally begin coming up from this state of energetic transference, having altered the unconscious parts of you, allowing you to act differently next time that you are in a similar situation.

And when you begin to change, it becomes exponential because as you become familiar with the process of releasing, you adapt and you integrate it .

I offer guidance in one to one sessions,  I create a container where we explore the psyche, the conscious or unconscious behaviours, limiting patterns, blocks which prevent us to follow through our dreams, the aspects of us that still hold hurt, the underlying reasons for stress and anxiety, the keys to clear grief and depression, techniques to release anger, regret and resentment, and more tools to transform and integrate other unprocessed emotions.

My commitment is to walk people into a space where they realise they have the choice to be anything they want to and take the responsibility to change.

I am very passionate about sharing my work with as many people as possible and I have created  different offerings for us to connect.

- Single session - perfect to bring clarity, to breakthrough, release and bring peace into a long-term challenge still present in life. This is the best way to connect with each other if we have not worked together before.
- Three session package - set to release a deeply rooted behaviour or pattern. This is the perfect option to achieve a greater goal and create long lasting change.
- My 6-week cycle mentorship program is opening up for 5 new people. This is ideal for someone willing to put in the energy to become someone new, releasing the old and accepting what has happened in order to feel in flow, fulfilled and empowered. The mentorship program leads to my practitioner training. It includes meditation exercises and weekly follow up.
- The full-day intensive immersion is a highly transformational and personally tailored in-person or online experience where we work through the most relevant and sensitive topics such as heartbreak, feelings of powerlessness, frustration and other intense episodes of challenging emotions. I bring advanced energetic clearing practices to let go of as much of emotional stagnation as possible and to release old and deeply rooted multi-patterned aspects.

With me, there are no halfways. We go deep. We open up to deeper levels of trust, confidence, presence, flow, clarity, authenticity, vibrancy, and a sense of inner guidance and effortlessness into our life. There is no way back. The impact is subtle, clear and transcendental.

If you resonate anywhere with what I am speaking and feel interested, let's talk about it. Reach out. Ask me a question. Tell me about yourself. I am curious to know how you are doing.

I came to develop my own way that allows me to navigate anything that is brought up to my consciousness. An awareness that allows me to perceive someone's field of information, understanding what the person needs in order to unlock the path to their self realisation.

I see the intertwined limiting patterns that need unknotting. I sense the integrity of the statements you share about yourself, discerning between the truth of your heart and the projections of your mind. When I speak, I speak to your subconscious, reprogramming the mind and dissolving the patterns that have been running unconsciously. I bring effortlessness into your process. This way, your change comes from a place of being instead of doing.
