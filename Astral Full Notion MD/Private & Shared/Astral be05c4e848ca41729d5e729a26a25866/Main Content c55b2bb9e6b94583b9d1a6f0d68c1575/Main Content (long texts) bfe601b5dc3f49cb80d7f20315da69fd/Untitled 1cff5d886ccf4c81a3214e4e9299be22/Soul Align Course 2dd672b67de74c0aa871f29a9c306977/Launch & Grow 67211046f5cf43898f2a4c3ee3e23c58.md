# My BIG Why

true meaning of spirituality and finding the essence in themselves to become their inner teachers, guides and masters

My intention is to teach people the true meaning of Spirituality, for them to reconnect deeply with the Self, and to awaken and spark the excitement and joy of life. To teach them how to be child like. For them to become their inner teacher and to master the energetics of our being. To discover the wonders of the energy bodies into the magical beings that we are. To grow and expand into a new way of living in this planet. To rewrite the story that we have been telling ourselves about ourselves into the great mysteries of the quantum life.
