I offer healing sessions.

Would you like to be free from your past? 
Would you like to be free from childhood patterns?

The subconscious takes 95% of your day.
And the subconscious was mostly developed during the first 7 years of your life.

Change your subconscious, change your life.

How would your life change without the old feelings of 'I am not good enough'? 
What would an empowered life look like?

I use Theta Healing Technique Â® to find limiting beliefs and replace them for empowering ones.

Have experienced childhood conditioning, trauma, abuse?

We will unlock the excitement and love for life. Nothing will ever be the same again. 

The only requirement is your desire to heal and take the necessary steps to fully manifest the healing.

Some testimonials includ

'This is the way it is supposed to be'?

The session includes replacing a CORE belief for an empowering one. When replacing a Core belief everything built on top of this belief falls too. 

If you're feeling stuck in an area of your life, or have been working in a pattern for a long time and seems like it's never fully going, then this is perfect for you. We can totally transform your life.

We will use applied kinesiology which means you get to see a subconscious belief before and after the session, proving the effect of the healing.

How would your life improve if you'd let go of the story you carry for such long time?

# You don't need to heal as there is nothing wrong with you.

I come to tell you there is nothing wrong with you. It never has been anything wrong with you.

What has happened is that people has sold you an idea of you that you are not, and you bought into it. You bought it as if it was a limitation of yours.

They told you you were not allowed to shine and you beleived them. 

They told you you were not worthy and you beleived them.

And then they even made you feel bad about the emotions you got because of their projection.

They told you you were not allowed to be angry, when you tried to fight for your cause. They told you that made you even worse, that you had to feel bad about it, guilty.

They wold you you were not allowed to show your emotions. That crying was for weak people, that strong people hold their emotions inside. That you were not allowed to express yourself. That even if you did no one would care about it.

But there's nothing wrong with you, really, it is just that your mind has been confused with what is you and what has been a projection of someone else, your parents, your schoolmates, your culture, your partners and your society. All of them projected onto you and they told you you had to be a particular way to fulfil their needs. They did not allow you to be yourself and they delayed you the chance of discovering what you actually were (are). They wronged you for being free, for being lightful, for being raw and being heart opened.

They could not understand you, and how could them, they were done the same by their parents, and their schoolmates, and their partners, their cultures and their societies.

Now you took those projections as yours because when you allowed them they actually look very similar to yourself. It's in disguise. And you know why? Your brain, your subconscious. It is the way we are as human, that we learn very quickly. It is the same that allowed you to learn words, to understand what setting the table meant, what a fork was, even before you can recall a memory from your life. 

It is the same very issue they work the Artificial Intelligence Engineers when they ask a robot 'pass me the milk bottle'. Do you know how hard is for a robot neural network to actually understand what it means? With the million probabilities of that being anything at all? Pass (to take) me (to me) and the bottle (could be anything) of milk (like anything else). When you knew that milk was actually possible to be in a bottle? What about a bottle of nails? Or a bottle of orange? Or a bottle of spaggetti? You get it?

The human brain does something very well, and that is learning. It learns by context. It learns by repetition. When you as a kid saw your parents asking each other please pass me the bottle of wine, you learnt that a container and wine were related, and passing meant to reach from one to another. When then they asked pass me the bottle water, you already realised that bottle meant the container, and that the last word was the contained. Now if they had asked you pass me the bottle of milk, you already could discern from table, and if you did not see any other container then you realised the milk one was that one.

How's that?

Now repeat the experiment.

What about when your parents argued with each other? What about when they talked behind each other's back? What about when they showed upset, and they did not communicate, or closed in, or shouted. What about when they were passive aggresive, when they lied, or when they did not know how to express something from the heart? What about when they were disconnected from what they were saying, due to anxiety or money problems, or worries? 

What were you learning then?

There's even more.

What about the energetics of their bodies? If we're all energy and we're all on each others energetic fields, what about the thoughts? What about what they thought of you, or of themselves, or of their partner, that they thought it was safe in their minds, but aha reality says that it was all merged into one? What did you learn then? Did you pick up stuff that was not even intented to reach you? Even when you did not interact with someone?

Is that feeling when you are close to someone who is very negative, that you begin feeling negative, or someone anxious that makes you feel anxious. It's by proximity we pick each others moods. Your neighbour feels so hungry you suddenly feel hungry even tho you just ate. And when your mother was being annoyed at you but did not want to screw with you so she said something nice? She holded a thought of annoyance whilst saying something pretty? What sort of confusion did you pick? 

I mean, our brains are the most advanced machines there are. Not the most advanced neural networks on the most advanced AI machines can still solve the problems that children can. AI is very successful in very specific problems and even then it needs Millions more times of repetitions and try/error that we humans do. Don't let them make you believe otherwise. Imagine a software and how many bugs they are. I mean, you have maybe used an app that just froze, that reached a code error and the app broke unexpectedly. Or maybe a button did not work. Or maybe some data was not shown how it had to.

We have literally learnt 90% of relation and life by the age of 18. 95% of your life is run by the subsconscious. This means that your personality is based on the subconscious that was imposed onto you by the age of 18.

How did you learn so much by the age of 7? You were in Theta brainwave state. lower vibrational frequency than your conscious. And it runs as default from 0 to 7 years of age. The time when we are still 'connected'. That which has been said 'kids learn like sponges'. The programming that happens in these times, all these learnings from your environment, shape you in the way that you confuse who you really are (which you know when you are that young! You are this beautiful being of love and light, shiny, joyous, lighthearted, forgiving and compassionate). You have began picking the stuff from your parents, their wants, their unwants, their punishments, their rewards. Their attachments, their possessing. You begin to imitate as you are in that mode because you need to learn how to function! (remember, otherwise, how would you hunt animals, gather fruits, survive in the wild, when we were still not in civilisation?)

I mean, we all remember Windows, or do we not?

Imagine your subconscious to be your Operative System. You run programs on it. Mac does. Linux does. Microsoft does.

# What we will do

ThetaHealing is a technique that allows us to change our life being. Thanks to ThetaHealing you can access the subconscious through the Theta brainwave state, which is a light sleep state, the dreamworld. From this place we access the Creator-Of-All-There-Is, pure Energy Consciousness, the energy that makes the atoms and the molecules. It's proved by science that we modify our reality with our focus {insert link of particles/waves}. When we intend to see a particle as a physical form, we make it so. And when we intend to find a wave, we do so. This means that whatever we put our attention on, we create in some dimension. Our subconscious makes up to 80-90% of our actions. Our subconscious thoughts rule our life.

I am not good enough. No matter what I do I will fail. People will reject me. My sickness is limiting me. It's someone else's fault. I can't.

We all carry certain beliefs that limit us in our everyday life. We may not be consciously thinking about it, but they play the most important part when we are faced with life situations.

Can I really aspire to more? Is what I think I want actually the highest potential for me? Does it really need to be that difficult? What are the right actions for me to achieve my goals? What are my goals? Can I have greater goals? What is my mission on this planet? Is this really all of it? Is there anything else?

We live our live's with those programs running as our OS, it's like running our live's basing our choices with that Windows can do for us, or Apple. It's letting ourselves limit for that which we believe is our reality. And the bugs! We live in a society that clearly has bugs, and just like the OS is best that we upgrade that which we run through, our OS, our subconscious, our connection to our hearts, our connection to the reality of nature, of what it really means to be a human being. 

Our love is that which makes up of the whole existence of All-That-Is. It's the basis of reality. It's the secret ingredient to All-That-Is.

We create our live's by choosing either love or fear.

At every event in our life, we either contract or expand, when we receive input from the 'outside' world.

Either we contract or we expand, and so having no negative beliefs that tip the scales towards fearful expressions towards ourselves would definitely feel good.
