# Action Steps

1. Reach out to my network and let them know that I am going to raise prices on September
2. Package Price increase by 3
    1. Create a Legal Contract for them to sign.
    2. People don't change everything they truly desire in 8 sessions
    3. Tell them you care about them and you offer them to lock the price for up to the next year before you raise your price. Offer to book in advanced for the next X months and get the current price before upgrade.
    4. Offer a payment plan, or a discount if all paid in advanced.
        1. There are companies that get the contract with the client, and the company pays you the total, and the person gets tied with the company legally, so you don't worry.
3. Raise x 1.5 in 3 months - then, 10% every 3 months
4. You can't force people to grow with you
5. Exchange assets for abundance. Your time is limited.
    1. Offer master class.
    2. Meditations
    3. Discount or Extra Session if booked within 24h

ðŸ’¡ I am worthy to be paid this amount. They bless me with their own investment on themselves. I get validation from partner, friends, God, not from clients, not from students. (If you fear or seek validation, they will feel it, and plant themselves low)

ðŸ’¡ Release projections around greediness, rich people. Book 'The Upper Limit'. Don't project PAST SELF into Clients

1. Share your story - be authentic (real, grind, good, raw)
    1. No matter if they get triggered
    2. Your clients will have similar soul lessons, so they need to feel they can trust you and that you will take care of them
    3. They want to be seen, heard, and understood
    4. Show the hurt, the breakthroughs
    5. Authentic visibility
    6. What you learnt from the experiences in your story
        1. Offer downloads for the parts
