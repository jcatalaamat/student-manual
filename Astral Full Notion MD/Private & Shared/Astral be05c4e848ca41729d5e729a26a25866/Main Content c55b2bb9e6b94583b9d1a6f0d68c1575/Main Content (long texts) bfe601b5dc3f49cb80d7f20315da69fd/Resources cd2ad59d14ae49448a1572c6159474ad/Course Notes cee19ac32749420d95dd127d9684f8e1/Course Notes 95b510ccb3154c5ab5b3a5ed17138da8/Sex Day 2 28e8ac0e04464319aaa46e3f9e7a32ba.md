# Trip Report

So much love came out of this session, I felt so in love with everyone that shared how they felt on the big group or in sessions where I was part of. Ariana felt amazing, and some of the things she said sparked some wild feeling inside of me, and then every partner I had was just perfect to allow that energy to flow thru. I felt I was in love with many. The exercises was great. We did the self touch on the face with hands crossed and it seemed we were stroking each other. It was great to see other people things that close them down and realising maybe I have done things like this before, so I don't want to do them again if it makes them feel closed down. The build up from the opening up completely threw my love, heart, and sparked of cheeky feelings for the people and my willingness to go deeper into getting to know each other <3
