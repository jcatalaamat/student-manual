- genetic → master cell pineal gland
- Creator of all that is, it's commanded that the radiation be pulled from my partner's organs, genetics, DNA and Devices. Thank you, It's Done, It's Done, It's Done, Show me :) → face, ears, hands, where laptop and phones are, legs
- MUSCLE TEST FOR GENE → I HAVE THE OBESE GENE, I HAVE THE CANCER GENE, ETC
