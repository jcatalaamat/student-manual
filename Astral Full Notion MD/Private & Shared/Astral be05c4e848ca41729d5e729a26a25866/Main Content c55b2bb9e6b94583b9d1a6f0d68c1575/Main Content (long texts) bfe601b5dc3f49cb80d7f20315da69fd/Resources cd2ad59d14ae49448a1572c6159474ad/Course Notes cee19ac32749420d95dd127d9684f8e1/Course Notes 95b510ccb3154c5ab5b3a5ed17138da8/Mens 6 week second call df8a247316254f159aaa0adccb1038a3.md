- BELIEFS TO TEST
- Fear of being hacked, stolen digitally
- Others cannot feel as much as I do
- I need others to be inferior for me to be a master
- I need incompetent people around me to take my mastery out
- I need people needing to be guided
- People only shares crap
- It's pointless to listen to people's stories
- People's stories scare me / bore me
- If I share the keys I really enjoy then I won't be needed as healer.
- If everyone is ultimately a healer I have to keep secrets for myself
- 
- EXPERIENCES
- Kirsty waves of shout and ecstasy, feeling sexual, moaning, me inside of her, she inside of me, having sex thru energies. I fucked her and she did to me, the others looked and took part holding space. Kirsty looking at me melting in her eyes when I touched her temple, automatically, triggered her to reach enlightenment
- ketamine night, me reaching enlightenment singing with eyes closed and body moving like a tornado from the hip. sang so much, so many different ways, I needed better music to unleash what's behind
- 2cb, feeling connected and playing with joline and holly's mind, was inside and could take them on a trip with me, merging often
- less and less thought, thought becomes action more often, when I engage with the energy, sometimes testing doesnt work. also testing with eyes closed going up for yes and side for no, no head movement.
- drove the girls into the thread, swam, sailed the poetry of each letter as the words dissapear into the infinite,
- right chocolate, always the right thing, beautiful as it is, how could life be everything that it is and more. example after example and going in circles to explain the same concept again and again. reading mind, even commenting 'icecream fountain' by holy when i said what was clear that was gonna happen and that i wanted to lay down
- i realised i want to be dearmored with love and self pleasure like cristina was speaking
- Believe what it is real for you. If you felt there were sexual energies flying around and you know it were not yours, don't let others people's project that that was only you or you decide to fit in with their story so you don't realise they can't listen to themselves or can identify what is going on with them. If anything, you know what you want, and you know intuitively where they are, read them automatically, so NO FUCKING WAY you made that up or screwed that reading up, they were totally sexual and can't accept it.
- Refuse the call, when that happened with the girls, I immediately numbed myself by silencing and keeping it to myself. Fear of rejection kicked in and just kept it for 12 hours.

Future you is always with you, stop killing insects
