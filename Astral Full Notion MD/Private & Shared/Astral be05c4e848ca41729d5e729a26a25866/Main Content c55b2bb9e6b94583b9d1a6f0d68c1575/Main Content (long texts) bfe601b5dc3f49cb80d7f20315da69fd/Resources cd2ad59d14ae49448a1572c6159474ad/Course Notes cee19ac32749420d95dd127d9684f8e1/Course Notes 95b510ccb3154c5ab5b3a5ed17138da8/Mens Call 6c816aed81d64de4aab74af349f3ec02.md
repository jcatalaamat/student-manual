- For a propoer functioning of Jordi
    - Crying 1 a month properly, really sobbing

# Patterns

- Mens find hard to cry, feel they cant access it or that
- I dont know - comfortability - feminine
- what is mine and what is imposed or from others
- only say sth when I am totally sure about it, instead of the making up mind,
- valuing the external feminine - i value this from her

# me

- hard to value woman, find reasons why i like someone, i struggle to get opinions from things or people, and scared to share and to be different than theirs
