# What are One-to-One sessions like?

One-to-One sessions are like a conversation, but more powerful. We induce a state of  

trance. In this state we can access the subtle energies and subconscious information in your energy field and body. What we do is to discuss what are the results you're wanting to create in your life. Then with a set of questions / practices we can direct that which is you to find the moment where limitations were created into you and release them.

# What is your work based on?

My work is based with energetic based therapy techniques and tools like Reiki, Theta Healing & Access Consciousness.

This is called Quantum Being, and it's based on quantum physics.

The tools I use are based on proven scientific facts. These facts expanded into These facts I have expanded into the reign of  spirituality to be able to understand the matching common ground found between these subjects.

# How soon can I expect the changes to be noticeable?

Immediately. The first changes are noticeable during and at the end of the first session. You may probably feel energy rushing through your body, expansion, feel lighter, more spacious, and ready for what is next to come in your life.

# What is your Mentorship program like? What can I expect from it?

In my mentorship program you get to choose who do you want to become in your life. This includes a mix of direct transmission and transformational tools for you to overcome all the challenges in your life.

Our first session is to find out in what direction is best to move over the following period. I will ask you the right questions to find out where in your life you would best benefit from working together.

This way we can get a map of what best to focus on for maximum results.

Depending on where you are and how fast you want to move we can arrange weekly or biweekly sessions for a minimum period of 2 months.

I will be teaching you ways of working on your own shadow and to empower yourself in a very lightful way.

The way I work is I listen to where you are and I show you what sort of language are you using. From there I can ask the right questions as a way to inviting new energies into your life, an empowered one. I gather the energies that are keeping you stuck in the past about how you make the choices in your life and we clear them into the space of awareness. It's like pointing a shadow with a flashlight and as it's brought into awareness it dissolves into the space. 

 

During the Mentorship program you don't only learn how to overcome the challenges in your life and release the projections and limitations that stand on the way between you and the life you 

It is like reprogramming everything that you thought you were into actually what you came here to be if free from the limitations and projections of others in your life.During the first session we will discuss where you are and come up with a specific plan for where you want to go. I will ask the right questions for you to realise what is your own Truth.

# Teaser

I ask you the right questions to activate your higher consciousness. Analysing the use of your language I am able to understand your underlying patterns. I bring awareness to the way you are relating to your story; clearing the energies, projections and limitations that are attached to it.
My sessions are never the same, as I becomes the space that you need me to be to be able to deliver the transformation that youâ€™re ready for. 

I believe that the meeting between myself and you is a synchronicity for both. I believe in the magic that everyone is. For me there are no limits into becoming. I work around the beingness of all beings. I am. My beingness defines the work that I bring to the world.
I deliver a non-judgement based transformational healing. I break the world of duality where most people find themselves stuck in, allowing you to elevate yourself away from everything you thought you were into the being that you truly came to life to be. 

I create space and consciousness around the truest of your being. I don't project ideas into your mind but open the space for new possibilities by inviting new and more expanded energy-consciousness into your field.
