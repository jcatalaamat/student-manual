# Holly’s words

Dear Jordi

Yes what a rollercoaster.

Thank you for showing me how to love myself, that my experience is my strength and my power runs deeper and further than this body I’ve been blessed with.

You are a supernatural spiritual being who has much greatness ahead.

My guide, grandfather, teacher, companion and healer. For as long as I live I will be grateful for our meeting, the orchestration of two ♓️ in a sea of confusion and fear. You’re the one I have been searching for for many years to take me into the next stage of my path. Brother, sometimes it felt like we were swimming against the current but ultimately we’re going with the flow and letting the universe take us where we need to go.

So so beautiful.

Your deep green eyes and long lady lashes, sweet locks of wealth and prowess which I loved braiding so, your strong body built for climbing feats and moving mountains. A heart so big I could feel it beat within mine. My feminine, your masculine, your feminine my masculine. The duality has given my so much growth.

The love, the heart ache, the acceptance and learnings.

Our meeting, sharing of space and journey through time and space have been profound and I will never forget all that you have done for me.

I hope the energy exchange has left you full enough to continue on your path of discovery and wonderment. You inspire me to always be true to myself and Devine path, to trust my intuition and to radiate love and compassion.

Your gift and purpose can change the world. Keep working on your shadows, the light will win. You are the brightest star with a golden aura.
A saint to me and much more.
