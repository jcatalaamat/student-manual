- They know about a higher power and are willing to surrender
- They have faced same challenges over and over again and even tho they do have a great practice and thrive in other areas of life, they still carry thorns stuck every now and then in places that they don't understand how can it be they are being treated like that
    - They still carry unworthiness in some aspects of their lives, in some interactions
- Healer of healers, teacher of healers, teacher of teachers
    - teach them how to breakthru themselves, not to get stuck on big issues, how to tackle the same old stories, how to release the deepest stuck emotions, teach them a technique that contributes to all of their work, by giving them the subconscious programming that allows them to unlock themselves from anywhere they may be,
    - teach people that healing is easy and that they dont need endless sessions with their therapist. they need to realise their gift, which I am an expert for, and tackle a minimum of challenges that dont prevent them to step in that power, from then onwards they can face it themselves
        - your corruption of having power, stopping too early on digging or thinking that you should be resolved already and have to release more emotions almost constantly, going from doing to being, forgiving everything, accepting all that is in the world,
        - little pieces → accepting their pace, stop self judgement, finding their anchor, how to become curious about your story and triggers to release, understand you allowed this to realise your gift and would be able to share this with the world
- men in my online mens groups, people in my online sex club
    - people who look for answers in grups online, people who are weird, outside of the trend, who dare to be outside of their comfort zone to look for answers about themselves
        - I know because I faced this and still didnt find my answers
