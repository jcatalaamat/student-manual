Quantum Rebirth is a radical new way to transform your life.

It is the crossing of many groundbreaking transformative modalities 

My work is based on the transcendence of healing modalities like Theta Healing and Access Consciousness, and it combines the wisdom of the traditional shamanic and quantum paradigms.

QR is revealing / based the subtleties of self realisation.

QR is a work around subtleties and self realisation. It is the art of clicking yourself into a state of beingness. It is the reconciliation between the Ego-Mind and Self. It is the end of the bypassing. 

It is the meeting of your True Self and the surrender to your Highest Path. It is the discernment between the limitation and the Truth. It is the inflection point in which struggle dissolves into the exciting expanding experience.

What I share is not something I have been taught or read in books. What I share is something I have experienced as I have been clearing myself from everything I was not. It is a work that has taken many hours of self observation, self clearing, partner shadow work, energetic work, communication techniques, physical practices, breathing practices, relationship heartbreaks, self destruction behaviours, abuse, the overcoming of the punishment of emotions, the abandonment of discipline, the death of conditional love, the reconciliation with the hurting aspects of ourselves, the psychotic breaks, the deep acceptance and allowance of what is, the forgiveness of the atrocities that we have done and undergone, 

What I have let go of has been violence, abuse, passive-aggressiveness, complaints, judgements, self negative talk, trust issues, over controlling mind, stopped fighting the challenges and learnt to receive everything as teachings, addictions to substances, anxiety patterns like nail eating, made peace with my body, changed food patterns, effortlessly let go of low vibration foods,  

*Jee Ka delivers a unique offering in personal transformation. Having mastered the tools that he learnt,
he channeled his own way of delivering a transformative experience of expanding consciousness.*

*He asks the right questions to activate your higher consciousness. Analysing the use of your lan-
guage he is capable to understand your underliying patterns. He brings awareness to the way you
are relating to your story, clearing the energies, projections and limitations that are attached to it.*

*His healings are never the same, as he becomes the space that you need him to be
to be able to deliver the transformation that you’re ready for. Jee Ka believes that
the meeting between himself and the receiver is a synchronicity for both. He be-
lieves in the magic that everyone is. For him there are no limits into becoming.
He works around the beingness of all beings. He is. His beingness defines the work that he brings to the world.*

*Jee Ka delivers a non-judgement based transformational mentorship. He breaks the
world of duality where most people find themselves stuck in, allowing them to elevate
themselves away from everything they thought they were into the being that they truly came to life to be.
He creates space and consciousness around the person’s truest of their being.
He does not project ideas or guesses into your mind, but opens the space for new pos-
sibilities by inviting new and more expanded energy-consciousness into your the field.*
