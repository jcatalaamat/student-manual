Hi!

I am feeling called to host a weekly exploration group session where I will be tuning into the group to channel what the group needs in order to step further in their own self liberation path. This includes a set of topics that are going to be part of my future training and any other topic I may feel would be beneficial to be transmitted.

There is space for comments during the transmission, clarifications, to bounce off the topic with questions that arise at the moment.

I will be sharing what I know from the perspective on teaching people about the wholeness of human beings, the new paradigm, emotional integrity, releasing the old, integrating the shadow, opening to the unknown, clear knowing, discerning between mind and heart, realising our own truth, stepping into our power, realising our life path, letting go of the blocks that prevent us from growing, becoming flow, facing our fears, letting go of suffering, understanding and stopping spiritual bypassing, letting go of mind patterns, understanding being, transcending the ego mind, stepping further into trust, learning to surrender, overcoming fear and anxiety, stop self-judgement, self-blame, guilt, shame, understanding the bigger picture, rewriting our story, reconnecting with our child like essence, expand our awareness, releasing blocks to limitlessness, surrendering to forgiveness, accepting what is, opening to oneness, unconditional love, the blocks to love,  

We will be opening ourselves to spiritual concepts, transformational and emotional  and how to best integrate them in all areas of our lives, and I will leave space for questions and answers regarding the topics discussed and also personal questions about anything spiritual.

An hour and a half exploration where we will tackle the channel that the group requires and with a question and answer session at the end.

- 30-45 minute transmission where I will channel what the group needs to explore on that evening. This may be a topic that feels required to be expressed or I will ask the participants to answer a question to be explored during the session.
- 30-45 minute Question/Answer session where participants can ask from their own experience regarding the topic discussed for personal channelled answer applicable to all participants.
- 15 minute Free Question session where participants can ask questions regarding any topic for a personal channeled answer.
