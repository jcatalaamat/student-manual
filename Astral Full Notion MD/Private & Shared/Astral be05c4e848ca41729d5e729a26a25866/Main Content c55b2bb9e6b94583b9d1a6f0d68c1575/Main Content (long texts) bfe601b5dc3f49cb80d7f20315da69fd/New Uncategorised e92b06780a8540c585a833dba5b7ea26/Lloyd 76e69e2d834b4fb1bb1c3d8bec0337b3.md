Hi Lloyd,

Thank you so much for the messages and the reflection you have been doing on your own. I feel that it is important for me to share that I have been on my own process this last week and I have realised about a few things I would like to share with you.

It is been challenging for me to give an exact time of response to someone when I have to integrate the process myself. I apology for taking time without expressing this.

I have been reflecting on the way I deliver the work I do and integrating the transformation that has been happening for the past months. It feels like every week I am on the edge of a new cliff and facing very challenging fears, following up with a period of integration and breakthrough that moves again onto the next big cliff.

In this process it has been challenging to keep myself accountable and responsible for other people's processes, specially when some of my actions or non actions seem to clash with some construct of how things should have been done. I trust that the timings are always right as I know that I am doing everything I can to stay in my heart and act from my most honest space. I trust that when I require time for myself it is aligned with the time others require. That it is an act of healing for both as we both are facing and releasing fears around it, bringing light into the unknown.

When I commit to walk with someone in the path of self realisation I have to commit myself to being the most truthful and open heart with myself as a way to deliver the cleanest transformational work. Because of so, I have had to reflect on my offering. I have been receiving  new information and ways of teaching that concern the work that I do. I have started working on new projects, developing new ideas and concepts. My life path is widening up in front of me and I require intense amounts of focus to keep myself in my centre with my unique gift. As a part of this journey I have faced the acknowledgment of the impact that this work does in people's lives. The value and worth I feel towards it shown me that I have to adjust my pricing and the shape of the offering in order to continue delivering the best. 

From now on I will work in 6 week cycles at a pricing of 1080â‚¬. In order to continue improving the work, I have also decided to record the sessions to transcribe some of the information for future content creation where there will be not be personal information disclosure.

I am very much looking forward to continuing this journey with you. And please let me know if you'd like us to have a quick call before next week. 

I suggest starting early next week and I recommend setting a new intention. I hear that the relationship challenges may be the most relevant theme to focus at the moment.

Much love & blessings, brother
