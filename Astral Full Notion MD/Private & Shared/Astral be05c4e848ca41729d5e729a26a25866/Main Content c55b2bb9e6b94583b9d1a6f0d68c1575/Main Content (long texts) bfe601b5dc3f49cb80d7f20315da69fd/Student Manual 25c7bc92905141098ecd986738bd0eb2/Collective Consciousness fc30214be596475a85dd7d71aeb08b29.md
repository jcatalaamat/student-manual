# Fear Based Entities (Shamanism)

Can there be high vibrational beings that are fearful? Let's say fallen angels. Is that possible? Can some powerful entities remain powerful even when they buy into fear? Does Satan exist? If its on the collective consciousness because at some point they feared it to exist, then it might. Then can angels turn out to be evil instead of remaining good? If people believe of God as an authoritative being, can somehow that also exist outside of the beliefs of people? If enough people think of that then would a new god entity appear? Is there an ultimate truth? Is good on the higher planes always good? If there is only love or lack of love (fear) then we can create a whole universe with a lot of fear based entities. Do these ones need to remain or can the love heal the lack of it and eventually disappear all that which was made of lack of love? Could a society based on fear survive to evolve to higher planes? As in like reach a point of massive technology like level 3 type of civilisation? Could a society based on fear actually exist as just energy form?

Did god create equal love and equal lack of love in the universe? Do they always need to be in perfect balance or there is a chance that lack of love disappears from the universe? Even lack of love is made up of love, as all matter is made up of love. What about consciousness? Is it made up of love? And how many different consciousness there are? Is it a hierarchy? Did one consciousness create more and then those created more?

Is consciousness always love and only the lense of the carrier gets tanned with lack of love? Is consciousness not love? If an energetic civilisation lives in the astral do they have an equivalent of the mind? Something like an ego? Do they die? Do they incarnate in their own shape or others? Do they know love? 

Are there in existence or ever existed  beings that can't feel love? How does that match a universe based on love? Like do we incarnate on earth because we have a heart chakra and otherwise in somewhere else we might not feel love? Could then a civilisation evolve to type 1 and still feel no love? 

In infinity all probability turns real. So what is all potentiality? Is there a potential that something is created evil? Is there a potential of everything is created loving but the lack of love turns them evil? And that they would seek expansion in the universe in terms of destroying? Inflicting pain from so much disconnect they have from source? But could a civilisation like this have enough power to be a type 3 civilisation? Wouldn't they get self destroyed on the process? Can a being become spiritually gifted basing themselves in lack of love?

If as humans we teach each other lessons as we attract that which we need to learn to get to the next level, we manifest the issues for them to be resolved, would it be the possibility of this happening in a planetary level, galactic level? That another entire species exists and is triggered by us so we teach each other a lesson? Would it be a compassionate lesson? Only loving civilisations can evolve to reach intergalactic level relationships? Whatever is source for us has to be source for everything else in the universe.

How do societies of beings, species in the non physical world actually get created?
