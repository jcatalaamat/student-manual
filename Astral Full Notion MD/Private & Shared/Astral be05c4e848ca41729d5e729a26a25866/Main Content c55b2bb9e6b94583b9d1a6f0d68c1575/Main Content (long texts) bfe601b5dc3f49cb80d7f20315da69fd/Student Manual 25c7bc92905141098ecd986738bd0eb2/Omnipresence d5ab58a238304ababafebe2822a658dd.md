# Creating numbers/images portals of transference

111 and 222 alarms can become a portal from the future to send wisdom and knowledge from anyone that has found a better and uplited way. It is where my future self sends guidance back to me and support into becoming that which I am, which is releasing the layers I have got and that are not me.

when we stablish a routine we can assume that the future of us will and can communicate to us with all that love and wisdom they have got when evolving. 

how does past affect future and future affect past?

past to future is obvious, given our circumstances we can see what we become in the future,

now future to past is the ability to connect to the future of us and receive guidance so we can shift the point of perspective about how small or big we are and expand into a greatness, which empowers us as it frees us from the limitatons of our current point of view
