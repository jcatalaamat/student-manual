# Sometimes there is more growth in not knowing than knowing

# Future Self

- Align to your best timeline
- Trust the inner guide

# Collective Consciousness

- The actions you take and perspectives of others about the subject that you are in are being affected by the collective consciousness of all

# Trust that you create your own reality

- Quantum physics (actualisation)
- Choose the perspective about the universe that mostly makes you excited. That is the one you want to live in. Then be committed to follow up the meaning of that into your everyday life and clear any resistance that your ego-mind is bringing up to slow you down.
- Create what is best for you
- Effortless life

# What is

- What is, is. Fighting what is is fighting life itself and the universe.
- If what is is triggering, you have work to do.

# Attachments or Expectations

- Positive attachment make you solidify in something that worked in the past and it may block you from new and better ways because an old way worked for you or because you get stuck in something you know you like and does not allow you to see or find something better which is in the unknown.
- Negative attachments are better than positive attachments because you have the motivation to get out of them. Tho they are actualisators because you buy into that something bad will happen to you.

# Manifestation vs Actualisation

- In manifestation there is ego mind. What we 'want' has projections and limitations from others and our past
- Actualisation is about the feeling of that which is aligned with us. So we align with that feeling of love or success and we let the universe that really knows what is best for us to actually actualise it in front of us. Is what we 'need' instead of 'want'. Is what is best for us.
- If we manifest from a place of ego, once we have it we are not happy or we have changed our ego. Imagine you finally manifest that which you thought you wanted 3 years ago into your life now and be like excuse me that is not aligned with me now anymore. Actualisation solves this issue.

# Triggers

- That which triggers you is there to trigger you to allow you an opportunity to grow yourself out of it.
- Whoever triggers you can trigger you because in you there is an opposite receiver that resonates to that of the trigger itself. You can't be triggered if you have worked enough and release that which triggers you.
- Trigger actor is as responsible as trigger responder. 1 don't make a fight, 2 do. If you get caught up in a trigger is in part because a part of you is calling the other person to test you in that area to see if you are fit enough to clear it from your field. Every time a trigger comes your way is for you a chance to overcome this completely from you.

# Fake it till you make it

- Bring in energies of that which you deeply know you are or you are to become. Embrace and embody the qualities of that which you are yet to be.

# Light / Heavy

- Open up to energy sensitivity
- Get the feeling of that which you really love or are aligned with
- Ge the feeling of that which you really dislike or are in misalignment with.
- The aligned one is a Truth for you, the misalignment is an Untruth for you.
- I am going to be a millionaire. If it is light in you, you know you will be. If its heavy in you, it may mean there are blocks on the way of becoming that and it's not a truth for you right now.
- Light is True for you, Heavy is not a Truth for you now, or it's a lie for you now.

# Asking Questions

- Opens the space for consciousness
- Consciousness clears unconsciousness
- Be ready for change
- Be curious, original, child-like when asking questions
- End the questions with words like how much joy, fun, transformation, ease, compassion can I learn this, or how can I be free of that
- questions will bring up what you ask, so when you ask for change and becoming, clearing limitations and aligning to who you truly are to be
    - consciousness is going to bring opportunities for you to step up
    - it's a calling for shadow work
    - you will challenge yourself with little subtle triggers to see where you are and outgrow your old self

# Master Embodiment

- In every opposition there is growth
- Everything that comes your way is a teaching
- Nothing that anyone projects is ever personal to you
- Everyone live in their own reality
    - Break their illusion by acting from a place of presence, mirror to them their qualities, so even when they are low you show them your gracefulness by sharing from a present open heart what are the qualities you see in them.
    - They see how great they are by being treated with the love that you are, you awaken them with consciousness, presence and love

# Inner Child

- Most clearings are relating to an Inner Child trauma
- Making the child understand it was not personal is key
- Apologise to the child for having experience that, it was not fair, not right that it happened. Make the child feel safe. Download the child with anything needed to break the pattern.
- Telling off the adult or person that projected the trauma is key
- Integrating the lessons is key
- What is the bigger picture of the situation?
    - Embrace the Master Embodiment
    - What is the Soul learning here?
- What is this an opportunity to learn and to let go of victimhood and empower yourself instead of letting the story take away you?
