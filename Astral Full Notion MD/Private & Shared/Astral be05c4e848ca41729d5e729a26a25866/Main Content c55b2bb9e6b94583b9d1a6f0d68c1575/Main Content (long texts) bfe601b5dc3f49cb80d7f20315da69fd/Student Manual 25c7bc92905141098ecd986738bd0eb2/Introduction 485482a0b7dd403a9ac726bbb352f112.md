## Introduction

In this manual I am breaking the world free from the projections and limitations that previous spiritual traditions have encaged the human race, whilst expanding the knowledge of the Self.

This is a guide for anyone who is in their spiritual path. There is no difference between someone who understands themselves as a beginner or as an intermediate to advanced level.

We are stepping into a new way of living, a new paradigm of existence. As such, the concepts you will find here may be provocative and not resonating at first. I suggest the reader to take what makes them feel lighter and let go of everything that does not feel aligned with where they are.

It is based on my background studies around physics, technology and the understanding of quantum physics. I have mostly been an atheist during my life, and the ideas that I will share with you here have been coming up from my inside out.

Information is that which the universe is made up of. This Infinite Intelligence vibrates in a Unified Field of Consciousness (the scientifically unproven Higgs field).

My speech comes from experience on the concepts themselves, not from reading or listening to others. In this manual I share the insights about what I have experienced, challenging and questioning everything that anyone has ever shared with me in both spoken or written words.

I am willing to marry science and spirituality and prove the world that we have always been speaking about the same when discussing in between these two. Call it building blocks of the fabric of the universe and our reality. Particles of Light, God, Source, or Pure Consciousness, they are the what make up the whole universe.

My biggest challenge during my spiritual revolution have been the merging between my logical mind based on my background as a software engineer and the reconnection to my inner Self and my heart. The shift in consciousness between requiring a proof to believe in the Infiniteness versus believing and actualising the shift.

Choosing was the biggest breakthrough for me. When I realised that everything I believed was based upon what others believed and had 'proven' in their own lack of openness.

My work is based on the simplest yet most powerful quantum physics learnings from the scientific community, applying these into the reflection on human consciousness.

## Beware of the transformation ahead

Even though I am sharing this information with you, I do not accept any responsibility for the changes that may occur from its use. The responsibility is yours, as is your sovereignty over your own energy, which you assume when you awaken to the truth, that you have the power to change your perspective on reality. 

Please note that the meditations and tools in here are not meant to substitute or be a replacement for professional psychological care and treatment.

In this book I will reveal some of the most powerful relationship energy healing techniquesÂ Â Â  available at this time.

There is one requirement for successful shadow work, you must have a central belief in Love as the Creator of all that is. I realise that love has many different names, God, Buddha, Shiva, Goddess, Jesus, Yahweh and Allah are all roads leading to love.Â Shadow healing has no religious affiliations. Neither are its practices specific to any race, gender, color, creed, or religion. Anyone with a belief in love can heal.
