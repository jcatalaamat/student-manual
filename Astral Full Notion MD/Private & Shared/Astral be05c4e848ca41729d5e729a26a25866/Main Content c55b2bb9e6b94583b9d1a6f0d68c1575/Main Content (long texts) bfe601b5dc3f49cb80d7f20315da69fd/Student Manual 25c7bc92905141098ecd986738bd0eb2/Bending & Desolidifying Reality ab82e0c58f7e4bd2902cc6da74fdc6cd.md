# Bending Reality

Let's say I tell you there's a magic society living underground. They know their spells, their alchemy. Everything magical exists as it existed in Diagon Alley, and it's been there since you were born. Your parents never figured it out for themselves or because they didn't believe in it, they didn't share the knowledge with you. It went under the radar. Actually you see, society push you towards the non believing of these realities. It even fits a purpose for you not to know it. If you don't believe your way then others can believe their way. So you buy into the sold reality that the world is currently giving, with its governments and societies. But when you were a child you didn't know about it yet, and you were yet magical, and you were yet believing.

When you awaken to the Truth that you decided to buy into their realities, more or less forced, and let them dim your light away, you will either blame them for doing that to you, or blame yourself for letting that happen. We do this so we protect ourselves 'oh they took my light, now I have no light and I don't have to do anything to get it back because it's too late' or 'I let my light go away and so now I have no light and I have no way to recover my light in such a world full of limitations'. To be able to look at what's happened to us and be compassionate and forgiving about it is not simple, both towards the outside but also the inside.

When mastering virtues like compassion and forgiveness, which helps us to look at the world and let go of all the negativity that we could in the past feel entitled to carry 'well they hurt me so I will carry this grudge because as long as I carry the grudge no one will be able to hurt me anymore so I am protected now and I am happy to keep this half way happiness than actually knowing myself better and growing fully with a full happiness'.
