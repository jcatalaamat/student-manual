# 2CB Experience

No: Yes
Yes: No

- What do you do when you discover this? When you feel it inside, burning like a wild flame?
- What do you do with it? What do I do with it? It only matters what I do with it.
- I bring it and share it with others, I create the space to allow this energy to blossom and expand, so others can feel it and play with it. Get used to it. Feel it. See it alive.
- What to do when you see something so beautiful? You can't keep it for yourself.
- The Light.
- It's alive on its own. You can share it, bounce it, vibrate it.
- I am the only one awake here? No, I am not. Start living as if others are awake too. Make them awake by treating them as awaken. Teach for your best student, as it will carry the group forward. Teach as a master. Teach whatever wants to come thru. Get used to just flow and say, some things may not sense some others will. It will become easier.
- It is always the same way, it surprises you when you were not thinking about it. And sometimes it is uncomfortable but it ends up going away and then you never see when it was uncomfortable anymore. It comes and goes in waves. It's like water to thirst and a food to hunger. It is both things and none at the same time. It is the space in between, the bits that are not one or others.
- Every letter is a wave and a whole poem is riding it as it fades against the wind of the words.
- It's both the voice and the silence.
- We carry it because if all life ends suddenly then it disappears.
- It is so so so so beautiful. It is so alive, so electric.
- And I have always carried it. If you pay attention you will remember how you always carried it.
