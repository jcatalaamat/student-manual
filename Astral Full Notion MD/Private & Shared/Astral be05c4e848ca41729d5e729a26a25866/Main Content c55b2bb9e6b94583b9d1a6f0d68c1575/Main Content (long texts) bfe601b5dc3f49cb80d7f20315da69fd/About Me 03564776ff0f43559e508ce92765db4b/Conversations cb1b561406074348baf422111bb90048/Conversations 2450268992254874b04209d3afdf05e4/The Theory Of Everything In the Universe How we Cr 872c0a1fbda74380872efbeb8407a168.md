# The Theory Of Everything In the Universe. How we Create the Universe and how to tap to the realms that interest us, when we're free from that which teaches us and makes us grow.

[9:42 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: thank me for having been an engineer
[9:42 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but I knew what I was writing about as it was coming out, its like it didnt come from a place of not knowing
[9:43 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it was not like trying to sing a song i dont know
[9:43 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it was singing something i am very passionate about
[9:43 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: like something I need to get out of myself for me to be happy with myself
[9:43 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: like that would make sense to me, and then I would be glad I knew what makes me tingle
[9:45 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Its like this is what I believe and the rest fuck all I want to live in my yuppie world
[9:45 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: which is similar to when other cultures have chosen their spirits and ways of working
[9:46 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it's like a spiritual science theory
[9:46 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: like i want those things to mean the same
[9:47 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and give the chance to everyone to choose what entities exist for them and where they get they info
[9:47 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: in a way to empower the one being in their live, we can only be sure I exist, not really that YOU do
[9:48 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so the whole power coming from within that one, in any way we can theorise it, as in like i dont want to give power to any entity unless I choose that entity myself because It turns me on to beleive in it
[9:48 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: thank you for reading me and containing my energy
[9:49 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it first felt a little triggering then I see the value of it
[9:49 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and you're the first person I ever share any
[9:51 pm, 10/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I would like to hear anything else you've got to share, it was empowering to hear what you last said, it was beautiful to see some of it landing and being acknowledged

# Initial Text

I can see the tightness of my words.

I create my own reality.

But I live in this world for a reason. Trying to change it into one that you can make fireballs sounds like not wanting to live in this one, yet I am on this one. Yet world breakthrus begin with some visionary. Otherwise who would first levitate or walk on waters, or bend spoons?

The world is co-created. It contains the beliefs of everyone who is alive, but it also contains the creation of everyone who ever lived, everything that has ever been touched, by science, contains the memory of everything that was. The earth is its own akashik records. Which means that the beliefs of all life existence is still creating the different dimensions that the world has.

This means that the shamanic, mayan, chinese, japanese and other cultures beliefs about entities are all coliving, in the same dimensional level. Fairies, elementals, etc are all the celtic and shaman and old tribes beliefs. Then the new spiritual people came along and when they became enough aware they tuned into the belief of the land, what the land had encapsulated as energy memoy akashic in the earth, so the first thing they saw was everyhting someone else has already seen before.

Is there a first truth? What came first? The spirit or the human? Was the astral dimensional beings already existing when humans came to exist? Were we a product of it? Or did our form appear as physical coming from an energetic being? Or the energetic being frm our psysical?

First comes thought, then matter. That means that we had to exist in thought before we became matter. That would mean that the elementals, fairies, and other beings already existed before they manifested physically on the planet. What created the first energetic entity? Who began imagining all the other realms? 

If it's all coming from thought, anything I imagine appears as form somewhere in the universe. If my believe in that is so strong, it will create more strongly. If I believe enough I can fly, I shall. Walk on waters. Create fish from bread. Wine from water. It is altering the atoms and molecules fo existence. If I can alter matter then I can alter energy, which is what matter is made from. That means that whatever my theory of the universe is, it will create it. That means that whatever imaginary friend I imagine, I create it in energy, so it will become an entity on its own, to exist around the astral, for others to see, if they are subtle enough to see it. The world is its own akashik record, which means that everything that existed or is still existing on any of these pyshical dimensions will potentially remain here. By the chain of energetic beleiving. Even if an entity believes in another entity, then that one will remain with power to be alive and conscious of its own way. Which means someone has to be imagining us at this moment in time for us to remain alive. Or now we keep each other alive because we are all knowing each other to exist.

Question: If everyone would at once believe in fairies, we would so much see them with our own eyes? Answer: yes. Because not so many people believe in them, then only the most psychic can see them with their psychic eye. And everyone knows that only when you believe first then you can actually create it. As everything comes in thought first. The limiting beliefs of each person will allow them to connect to what others believed in the past. So I know the word meaning of 'trickster' and i know the meaning of 'being' which means my brain understands 'trickster being', so if in any level I believe this can affect me and could potentially teach me something, then I will allow this energy to be around me and to effect me in any way that I would let it for me to learn that lesson, and, eventually, move on from the lesson into another place. This explains why we would let waywards effect us in the beggining, until we clear them and then this will never be an issue again. So In some level we allow these energies to work with us, like little entities in our third eye, if these help us to be more disciplined. if a belief inside of my brain is saying 'i am not disciplined enough, therefor I need to create something that will catch my attention for me to focus and grow, and become more of who I believe myself to be, then I will allow it to effect me in some way, for me to realise and grow'

To be continued...

Can I control or do I need to assume I have no control about what happens to me?

Do I want to speak with all trees? Is that important? How much do I buy into nature stuff only because someone said it was important? Or because It's the 'natural' state of the planet? Everything is made of the same particles. Everything is spiritual. everything is God.

Writing a theory that marries every other theory of energy and spirituality into one, that allows all to exist but also that allows people to disconnect from the parts that they don't want to resonate with.

It's like the science behind the spirituality. Why we choose to make life spiritual when it all comes defined by science. How they two merge, how to explain the spiritual by the science. And why we can choose to see the world in the way that makes us tingle.
