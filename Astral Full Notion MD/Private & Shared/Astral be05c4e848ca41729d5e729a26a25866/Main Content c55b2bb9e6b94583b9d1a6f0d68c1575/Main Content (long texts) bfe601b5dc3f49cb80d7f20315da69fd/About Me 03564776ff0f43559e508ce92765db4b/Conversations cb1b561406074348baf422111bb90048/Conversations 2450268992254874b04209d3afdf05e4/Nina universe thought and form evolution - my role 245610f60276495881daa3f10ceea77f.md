[10:33 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: There is Kay‚Äôs family they watch tv smoke weed and laugh and talk all at the same time and eat cake
[10:34 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ah the munchies with cake hahaha
[10:34 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: u get them when they speak so fast
[10:34 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ahha yepppp
[10:34 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Nop I‚Äôm lost
[10:34 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üòÇ
[10:34 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: damn weed. tastes so good and makes u feel so great LOL
[10:35 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but not having it with my awareness this time I get to see what makes me want it, what parts get unbalanced
[10:36 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Makes me slow and stupid . I just like it as an aphrodisiac it‚Äôs wonderful to make love
[10:36 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: there's this thing
[10:36 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I have probably worked a lot with it
[10:36 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: there is a moment in time, when weed cant be used social
[10:36 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and you have to embrace it
[10:36 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and say sorry I willl meditate now
[10:37 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and then you fly sooo high
[10:37 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes for meditation also is wonderful
[10:37 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: But it‚Äôs like I go into an illusory space
[10:37 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes, so whenever I smoke I warn, I will have to stop socialising after it wants me to go there
[10:38 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: uhmmmm tell me more
[10:38 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I have had plenty of breakthrus with weed
[10:38 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and crazy energy releases
[10:38 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Often I think I‚Äôm having crazy breakthroughs
[10:38 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ahah
[10:38 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: LOL
[10:39 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And then when I check it was not substantial
[10:39 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: WOW
[10:39 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: how do you check?
[10:40 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: we have used substantial twice today, that's substantial
[10:40 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Hahaha
[10:40 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I see how it affects you huh
[10:40 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Hahaha
[10:41 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: How I check : I write things down and I read them when not high üòÇ
[10:41 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: mhhhh
[10:41 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: okay I often dont write things
[10:42 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I have written (as a summary) about a sensation that I have had many times with weed
[10:42 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: which is this idea of having a massive breakthru and then quickly forget about it
[10:42 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes that‚Äôs what I call the illusion
[10:43 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: For real weed saved my life I used since 13 years old to b able to moderate my emotions
[10:43 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I preferred to believe that I had the experience and the change went into the subconscious, so I only had to trust it, the only importance for a realisation is to go deep into the subconscious, we wouldn't hold with so much info in our conscious
[10:44 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes I admit that for some of us it can b transcendental
[10:44 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so I worked on trusting that and downloading myself with certainty that changes were important and that subconscious would remember, weed helped to experience it instead of just knowing about it or consciously hold it in the mind
[10:45 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: not defending weed tho, I can see how slacky makes me when abusing it, which is often when I have it, but sometimes I do because those times I am depressed and that's a first choice if I have it around
[10:47 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Weed is an abusive lover that has a cosmic soul and feeds from our energy in exchange for showing us wonders
[10:47 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: How has been your evening
[10:48 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: damn
[10:48 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that's a cool description
[10:48 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: in IA we learn to download and release beliefs of medicine
[10:49 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: when I have had weed and friends had, now in portugal, I preferred we always used mine because I had pre-blessed it all, with tabacco included, otherwise I had to properly bless my friends splifss
[10:49 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I see plants as entities like I can perceive their vibe . I know it‚Äôs beliefs and also my own story with them
[10:49 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes this def changes the whole experience
[10:50 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that's cool
[10:51 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I have had a connected evening, read a bit of alice bailey on initiations, which led me to a word antahkarana
[10:52 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: which led me to it's symbol, then i read about about few old spiritual theories, then about the lost continent of lemuria, then to the reiki symbols, which really activated me, then because of the symbols I went into reading about a few angels from the angels books and some masters, and downloaded myself with a lot of things and then again the freaking symbols were like a magnet
[10:53 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: had never looked for the reiki symbols even tho I did reiki 1, i thought I had to wait for reiki 2 LOL
[10:54 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: as if it was forbidden, I mean, my teacher hasnt taught me level 2 and a number of things that go from there because she's in china
[10:55 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: something came up, and obv I did reconnec tto the idea of angels and made peace with it, as I want to see what the 7 rays are, and want to understand the strong classic mention of angels and so on
[10:55 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: there are questions I have
[10:57 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: like how did we come to exist, and did spiritual entities exist before the physical bodies? like who created all these entities all these angels all these beings and light beings that have no physical form, and were we then created from them? if matter comes from thought, a little about the universe basically... I wonder if thought creates entities then our thought creates the spiritual world also, so I dont understand it's again the chicken and the egg LOL
[10:58 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
[10:59 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: What if angels are a form of consciousness// energy
[11:00 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I have some issues between darwinism, DMT molecule and entities already existing before we evolved
[11:00 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Cause if consciousness took human form it could also take other forms
[11:01 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: then it had to go thru evolution
[11:02 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: why are there some people saying there are high dimensional beings that are praying mantis
[11:02 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: in a way I feel that physical form was needed for spiritual evolution on the abstract layers
[11:02 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes this resonates
[11:03 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ok or maybe there is something around thought forms
[11:03 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but that would'nt explain so many civilisations that are only energy forms, if no one thought or projected them first
[11:04 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I can‚Äôt quite wrap my mind around . If humans created all those entities
[11:04 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yeah and in tgeory is thought that first creates form
[11:05 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[11:05 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but that would mean that we humans existed before in energy than physical
[11:05 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that everything physical would have existed first in energy
[11:05 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so we had energy/astral bodies before we managed to incarnate?
[11:05 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Or if they‚Äôre is different type of beings from more subtle to more dense
[11:05 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or then we are getting into 'the human experiment' the idea that another energy civilisation actually designed the humans
[11:06 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I beleive that we existed in energy before physical
[11:06 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: But there is something bugging me about another civilization designing humanity
[11:07 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: well, there is no 'other'
[11:07 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: If in the source everything is energy then all type of beings coexist. The physical body belongs to the earth
[11:08 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üòÖ
[11:08 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but then
[11:08 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: did every prehistoric human, before homo sapiens, existed in energy first?
[11:08 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: maybe I am using the wrong terms
[11:08 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: cognitive capacity in pre-humans was very limited due to food intake etc
[11:09 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so those beings were rather stupid
[11:09 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: pardon the expression
[11:09 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and like how that is already clashing with the idea on consciousness on every thing and plants and trees (even tho these have lived way longer than us)
[11:09 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I see two separated things . The consciousness and the form . The consciousness is like a virus that is mutating . It uses form to be able to evolve and adapt
[11:10 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Maybe the vibration of consciousness is shaping the form
[11:10 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: consciousness a virus, first time I hear this and never thought to cross my mind, tho actually is slightly fitting to the occasion LOL
[11:10 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üòÇ
[11:10 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I guess the question is what is formless consciousness and what sort of things is it thinking
[11:10 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: t's like a freaking AI machine
[11:11 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: just 0s and 1s
[11:11 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Is there thinking involved .. idk
[11:11 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: well true there is no mind, so consciousness itself is like a flow
[11:12 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[11:12 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: then god was a baby, or is still a baby :)
[11:12 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: This ü•∞
[11:13 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: wow i re-read and that came from nowhere but I do know I guess where it came from
[11:13 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ah yeah the idea that a force that can create but does not think, it's like a dog or a cat, or a horse
[11:13 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: they are being
[11:14 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: like a monkey, that can learn to create tools
[11:14 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or humans, that create a hell of a lot more things, but imagine how long it has taken us to do what we do and we do it pretty badly anyway
[11:14 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: In terms of the universe we are only at the beginning
[11:14 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: agh but here I get crossed with the re-writting of history and get slightly lost with older civilications like lemurian and atlantis etc
[11:16 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Maybe this civilisations are co existing
[11:16 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: They are potentialities
[11:16 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Or other dimensions
[11:16 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Idk they also seem to me like something that is a distraction
[11:17 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: brain candy
[11:17 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: That‚Äôs why I would drop them they are not an important piece of the work
[11:17 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes brain candy üç¨
[11:17 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: mhhh
[11:17 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Exact
[11:17 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but why is egyptian ok?
[11:17 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I like this brain candy thing
[11:18 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I mean jsut because we dont have science having proved them?
[11:18 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: for me the interest is, did we have a greated knowledge before, and not now?
[11:18 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: like mayan and egyptian
[11:18 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and how did they know
[11:18 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes √©gyptians ok cool they are interesting they did good art and esoterical stuff
[11:18 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if we became so dumb after
[11:18 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: But same we don‚Äôt need them right now
[11:18 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: (i love when kero is sleeping and dreaming and he starts moaning on his sleep, I think he is having some sort of nightmare lol)
[11:19 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that looks made with a fucking laser computer
[11:19 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Probably from his past life as an √©gyptian god
[11:19 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it would make sense he was the king and I was the prince
[11:19 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I have already visited some of those lifes as prince LOL
[11:19 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: forgot last time
[11:20 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes aha
[11:20 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so for me its intriguing evolution, the missing link, and the consciousness we had in an energy body before we were physical
[11:21 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: were we spirits saying (oh man cmon discover fire so we can cook and then your brain will grow and then we can finally incarnate)
[11:22 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üòÇ
[11:23 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: What can we learn from that in order to keep evolving
[11:23 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I mean I see where it‚Äôs fascinating but something in me has resistance to look there
[11:24 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ok not about atlantis and this stuff
[11:24 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but just about humans and what i just said?
[11:24 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if with our belief we create entities
[11:24 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So maybe consciousness was already in the little amphibious creature
[11:24 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: then either we created the universe we live in or at least what we observe
[11:24 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or something created us
[11:24 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Coming out of water
[11:25 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes every creature had DMT or at some point that was introduced
[11:25 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ok ok maybe it‚Äôs like a cycle and not something linear
[11:25 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so creatures began to be spiritual and connect to source
[11:25 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and some became mega intelligent, I guess, like as they would say praying mantis, and they would ascend
[11:26 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So consciousness incarnate in human an human helps consciousness to take all the other forms
[11:26 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and these super intelligent old creatures would begin playing with the universe
[11:26 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Or humans become witness of all the other forms and as they are able to observe they give shape
[11:26 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: non human beings, insects have been waaaay longer than us, much more chance of existence, in any livabe planet
[11:26 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: But this is an ethnocentric
[11:27 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes sure but insects can‚Äôt create entities
[11:27 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: They don‚Äôt have imagination
[11:27 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: well the idea is, if spiritual insects existed way before us, and they were enlightened, then why the vast of our culture is about human-like form spirit beings? (yes i know they are light, and maybe they take form as human for us not to freak out)
[11:28 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: maybe not the ones here now
[11:28 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so what consciousness has a cat?
[11:28 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: does it know it exist?
[11:28 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It has a consciousness that doesn‚Äôt oberve itself
[11:28 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I love this
[11:30 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and insects cannot create things because they dont have pyneal gland or sth like that? so their spirituality is shit?
[11:30 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Maybe only humans are able to help the conscious evolution because they are conscious that they have consciousness
[11:30 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: maybe we needed a more evolved being then
[11:31 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Insects are into being ness
[11:31 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes that makes sense, once a planet has a being that has gained enough over the others, and has been able to grow their consciousness
[11:31 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[11:33 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so consciousness created entities that were based only with energy body, and then we were created as physical first and that gave us energy body?
[11:33 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or we actuall existed as energy body, lived in different planets, travelled around, then found earth, and were like oh look there are some sort of monkeys here, maybe we can sneak into their bodies
[11:33 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or maybe we can manipulate something of theirs to make it perfect for us
[11:34 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes this seems cool ü§™
[11:34 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and did we exist as energy human consciousnes,s with a sort of an energy shape human body? or as something unreladed?
[11:34 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I mean all these theories about spiritual cities where we learn to come to earth, well that would mean we are from other places but now we incarnate as humans
[11:35 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes I believe there is something from out there that came to earth inside this monkey bodies
[11:35 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that would actually be like there is a ton of cool places out in the universe, and they found some monkeys here, and they said, EH! they about to become conscious, lets create this homo sapiens and it has so much DMT and we have added energy centers etc and so we can all come here and experience what is to be physically alive, but lets all forget that we come from complete different ends of the universe
[11:36 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I just feel how vast this conversation can be, to be able to grasp it and have checked different avennues
[11:38 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: cats have chakras, did they have them before we observed them? do all creatures have chakras? do all creatures have energy bodies?
[11:42 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I need downloads on that topic it‚Äôs like there is something slipping h out of my hands like a slippery fish
[11:42 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Also now I just sit and smile observing your spirit jumping around
[11:43 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: hahaha
[11:43 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it's dense
[11:43 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: feels dense
[11:43 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Trying to understand all it brings me a lot of joy
[11:43 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: well its because this goes tighly attached to the idea of
[11:43 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if we create our reality and we create form in energy or even physical, as humans
[11:44 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: did any of the form we speak about come before we did?
[11:44 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or did it come after we did
[11:44 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and I feel thats an important question
[11:47 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Maybe it‚Äôs THE question
[11:47 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: BUT
[11:47 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: This after or before means that time is linear
[11:48 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: agh fuck I never think of that
[11:48 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: fuck that sentenc I just said
[11:48 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I am still to much in scientific mind when it comes to that
[11:48 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so cyclic would be all these about the ages no?
[11:49 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: That‚Äôs why i always come back to quantum physics

[11:57 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: as if my whole research was going to go around THAT question
[11:57 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: shit
[11:58 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: well i do want to speak about how to unite all religins in their beliefs and what they created and why they were all valid
[11:58 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and so how for everyone to choose what they create in this life and get the support from the level they want
[0:01 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but for example in shamanism theres so many different entities, were these existent from beforehand or did we create them with our fears?
[0:01 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Time again
[0:01 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: like imagine us, poor humans, surviving the wild, beleiving the sun was dissapearing every night and not knowing if it would come back again
[0:01 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: projecting all of that into entities
[0:02 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes we had to create meaning
[0:02 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: This is inherent of our constitution
[0:02 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Condition
[0:02 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes so that means that there is a lot of limiting beliefs culture still existing in the earth akasha, just because we did not know better
[0:02 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[0:02 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Same than science
[0:03 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and because we cant unify the theory then they remain there, bothering people
[0:03 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: slowing the path of many
[0:03 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: We though earth was flat until proven otherwise
[0:03 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: its like trying to be healthy but the air contaminated
[0:03 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And matter was empty
[0:03 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes true :D
[0:03 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: some still beleive is flat LOL

[0:04 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: trying to run amazingly but living in a poluted area, and drinking bad water and unhealthy food, it just doesnt perform well
[0:04 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[0:04 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So how to create better conditions for all
[0:04 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: well first clean what is there
[0:04 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that is awareness
[0:05 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: when people realise the hurt on the planet, we will really change our choices and ways of doing
[0:05 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: when we really realise that most entities are limiting, we can release them together and create a new astral world
[0:05 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: WOW
[0:05 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: .

[0:08 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: activated me
[0:08 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: This question just came through me suddenly
[0:08 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: release so much
[0:08 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: its good it forces me to look at it as when i get asked these things I am already answering so many qustions so its best time to stimulate the flow around it
[0:08 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Like ‚Äúi‚Äù was activating a mechanism
[0:08 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: my ego does not want to know, it is scared of what it may mean
[0:09 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and at the same time it dreams as it wants an important role
[0:09 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: for both small role or big role
[0:09 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ok then let go of the ego anyway something happened in your field when the question appeared
[0:09 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: No need to answer
[0:10 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I need to close my eyes
[0:10 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes something happened for sure

[0:17 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Too late I red it already  üòõ
[0:17 am, 14/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Good night cosmic prince
[0:19 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: there are so many scientists that spend their life on one theory that never gets finished or published or gets disapproved
[0:19 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and there have been so many also that came up with a new religion
[0:19 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I'm not sure I want to be just one more
[0:20 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but it's not about my wants, today was all about surrendering and knowing that creator, the divine intelligence flowing thru me will take care of me and will make thru me what is right for me for the good of all who will be affected by it
[0:22 am, 14/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: tell me I am not meant to answer yet, it's still activating me and my ego is dying
