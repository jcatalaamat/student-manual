# Nina is triggered - consciousness reflection on itself

[10:57 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: can I talk to u? im super triggered today like, everything ppl project on me make me super angry and reactive
[10:57 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: i thought expressing it would help
[10:57 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: cause if not im going to attack someone
[10:57 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I knew it
[10:58 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Is this talk or you mean phone?
[10:58 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: idk
[10:59 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: here ok
[10:59 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: You're like stop throwing me your bullshit take care of it
[10:59 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes fuck
[10:59 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: im like i dont need any advice or any thought on anything concerning myself
[11:00 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: because ppl project their limitations on me
[11:00 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ask yourself, who does this belong to?
[11:01 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: OK
[11:02 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ahah
[11:02 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Just connecting to you r energy is releasing a lot of tension
[11:03 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: So it's still the ego mind who's being triggered now that the ego is closer to divinity also feels like the only important advice is the one coming from your source
[11:03 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[11:03 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And that everything else is a disturbance
[11:03 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: So it's upset 'you've never really helped me why should I listen to what you have to say' it's like being upset with god because it feels that you had to do all the work and never were really supported by others
[11:05 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: This is coming up for you to find a new subtlety to your power
[11:05 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It‚Äôs more like ppl try to support but they do it through their own prism
[11:06 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Which is limiting my power
[11:06 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And also they don‚Äôt let me be fully then
[11:06 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: They do it thru their own prism that's what I mean that a part of you feels like nothing was ever solved by that sort of projection whilst still the trigger is there so something for you to learn
[11:06 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I I feel I need to fight against them
[11:07 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: So their prism is actually still teaching you sth
[11:07 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[11:07 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Yes that's because in the past you felt like the judgement of others would eventually destroy you and your spiritual path
[11:08 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[11:09 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: You don't let yourself be fully because they are there. This is a hard one I know by heart how difficult it is to be the light when others are not
[11:10 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It's almost 'I hate humanity'
[11:10 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: YES
[11:11 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Why do i have to do extra work just because they are stupid
[11:12 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: So here you lost track that the universe is always bringing you what you need to Uplevel and that when we ask to open up more we don't always do it instantly and magically but the universe brings people that will give us the opportunity to Uplevel in the present moment
[11:13 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: These are still parts you are annoyed of yourself
[11:14 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[11:14 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I lack courage
[11:14 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: From your ego when your ego projects because now you've tasted such divinity that when the ego goes off you're like damn  don't get me away from my sweet light
[11:15 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I would like to b totally independent of anyone projection or love
[11:15 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Ask yourself what does it take for me to overcome this?
[11:15 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[11:15 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: And how does it get any better than this
[11:17 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Who would you be if you were immune to people's projections
[11:17 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: And how would you be there now and whatever is on the way would you destroy and uncreate
[11:18 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: There is something with truth that is destructive but beautifully
[11:18 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Like there is no complaisance
[11:18 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: No making the other feel good
[11:18 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It‚Äôs raw
[11:18 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I adore it
[11:18 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Truth is sometimes hard but you can deliver it with compassion
[11:19 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: But when it express it‚Äôs like Kali
[11:19 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: What's the most loving response you can ever give someone that will always uplift you to the next level
[11:19 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes it‚Äôs like I need to find that balance
[11:19 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I see now
[11:19 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: And obv don't judge yourself if you feel there was a better option once you have already acted, what's the most loving response you can be without causing strain on your being
[11:20 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Standing in truth with no animosity no agressivity
[11:20 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Often we lack the compassion when sth is hard because we're upset that it was not delivered to us with the same love
[11:20 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: But that's exactly when we break the chain of slavery in the world
[11:20 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: When someone is expecting you to act in punishment but we deliver love instead
[11:22 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Its like a shock to their system and things get rewired.
[11:23 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It is alright it also reminds you you're still human
[11:24 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: That there are still triggers out there. And how to be compassionate with ourselves when we have gone slightly ofd
[11:24 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: How's it feeling
[11:26 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It‚Äôs landing . I def feel relaxed now and more spacious as I integrate that . There are things still
Unclear . I understand that I fear to loose connection with source because of the projections of others
[11:26 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And that my reaction is to defend my territory
[11:26 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Like some kind of animal that would b disturbed in the jungle üòÖ
[11:27 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And also it‚Äôs teaching me to be able to stay centered in any circumstances
[11:27 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: That I don‚Äôt need to fight
[11:28 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: The reaction is the fear that they still have power over you to create disturbances in your field
[11:28 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[11:28 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So I need to take this power back
[11:28 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Beautiful
[11:28 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üåàüåàüåàüåà‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
[11:29 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: So the best way to recover your power  is compassion because God will see how you've taken the  attack and transmuted it into love
[11:30 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It's an energy thrown to you and you can either feed it wood or throw it water
[11:30 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes yes yes yes
[11:30 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: You're an alchemist and you get to transform what's given to you into anything you would like and you're capable at that moment
[11:30 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ahoooo il
[11:31 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Now just remove the alchemist that's a box sorry üòÇ
[11:31 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ahah
[11:31 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: But you always be who you be when you be
[11:32 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ilyyyyyyyy fuck thank u for existing
[11:33 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: the energy shift gets you to your next moment of beingness
[11:34 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ahahhahahahaaaa youhoooo
[11:35 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Now I‚Äôm like yes bitch give it to me and I‚Äôll dissolve it in incandescent love
[11:35 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Anything that we have spoken that is not aligned with you would you let go now?
[11:35 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: üò∏
[11:35 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: YES
[11:35 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Much bettah
[11:36 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ‚ù§Ô∏è
[11:36 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ü§©
[11:36 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üôèüèª
[11:36 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Haha
[11:36 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: This flow
[11:36 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I‚Äôm gonna jump in the sea
[11:36 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It just wants me to keep going
[11:37 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Give it to me
[11:37 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: What is there
[11:37 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It's getting me ready for long hours of channeling just lil dain heer
[11:37 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[11:37 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I wonder how much easier can this get
[11:38 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: And still be exciting and promising and fun
[11:38 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: How natural it can come out
[11:38 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: How empty and how clear can it be
[11:39 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes üôå
[11:39 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: And anything that doesn't allow that to show up will we destroy and uncreate
[11:39 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
[11:40 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It's like it wants my own way and I'm still using access
[11:40 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ahaha i am giggling
[11:40 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Whilst I am not an access practitioner üòÇüîî
[11:41 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Or am I
[11:41 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes you‚Äôre constantly learning// unlearning
[11:41 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I'm scared that I'm using so much access as telling me that's what should be vs you're still doing your own. Well aren't they just tools? The mix match can have a bit of everything
[11:41 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: But I'm unhappy of using the same terminology. Even in acc√©s they speak about 'points of view' and not beliefs
[11:42 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[11:42 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I see the value because it connects a new expression to a new concept otherwise when u speak of belief you connect to all the other ways of releasing them and that can get dense
[11:43 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Maybe that's why beliefs take so long to release because everyone who's ever said the word belief and how they thought they'd clear then we carry that on the collective consciousness ü§Øüôèüèºüîî
[11:44 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: KABOOM
[11:44 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ‚ù§Ô∏è
[11:45 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
[11:45 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Subconscious point of view? It's like sometimes we use a vocabulary because we think people then can understand us better but that may be limiting on itself
[11:45 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So not only they need to rewire their belief but the ones of the collective
[11:46 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ?
[11:46 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Yes it would be like saying at the end of a theta command  can we also release the expectations of any person in the world that would believe this can't be changed in this way because they believe beliefs take long to change?
[11:46 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: That would be fucking tedious and long and maybe that's why there's so much drama because beliefs have been removed with a lot of drama in the past
[11:46 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Or sth like this
[11:47 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Even using the word subconscious may be limiting
[11:47 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Because we're already putting it in a box
[11:47 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: What if that belief is conscious
[11:47 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Or unconscious
[11:47 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Or whatever the heck
[11:47 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It's an energy
[11:48 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: We're trying to move away from words and boxes and go into energy shifts
[11:49 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Can we heal something without having to use the mind at all?
[11:49 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: That there are not even words in our mind whilst we enable the healing
[11:49 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: And how would we teach this to people
[11:49 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes
[11:50 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: And how would we Master it and understand what needs to be understood to replicate it and trust it and surrender to it
[11:50 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: How can someone believe they have healed the issue they came with or all the issues relating to it without having to use almost any words?
[11:51 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ayyyyyy
[11:51 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ahahah
[11:51 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: wait
[11:51 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: What would it take to be that and to live like that and how much playfulness be whilst  being it
[11:51 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: maybe its not about focusing on whats need to b released
[11:52 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: but focusing on what can b created
[11:52 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Possibilities that's what acces talks about it what if there was another way yes
[11:52 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: maybe also there is something about presence ; as you said
[11:52 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: if you are infinite possibilities
[11:52 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: then when youre next to someone
[11:53 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: you unfold their infinity
[11:54 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Go on
[11:55 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: manifesting only , what was the other word ?
[11:55 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Actualisation
[11:55 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: VOILA
[11:55 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: its about ACTUALIZATION
[11:55 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: so , if you actualise, you dont need to fastiduously remove things ,
[11:56 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: if all is possible and there is no limitation
[11:56 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: change can happen in a instant
[11:56 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Yes instant actualisation you instantly create that newness in you
[11:57 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: just connecting to the quantum field and be a miror for the other
[11:57 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: without labbeling his issues with limiting words like
[11:57 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: wait
[11:58 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: it happened to me that only in presence i could let things unfold a little bit like when i told u the dream
[11:58 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: damn im being unclear now
[11:58 am, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It looks a bit like a relationship with a master because you really do need the practitioner to be able to completely connect and awaken that in the other?
[11:58 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes exactly so your following me
[11:58 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: i was exactly there
[11:59 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: like how can we create this master // realtionship
[11:59 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: in an instant
[11:59 am, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: creating such opening and receptivity and awarenes that you can b touched and knwo and feel everything of the person
[0:00 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Its a cathartic experience
[0:00 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: and that he feels that you know and understand
[0:00 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Like anything could happen to the one receiving
[0:00 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It's like causing a dissolution of the mind in the other person
[0:00 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: YEs
[0:00 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: and how to do that ? only by dissolving your own mind
[0:01 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: And it's more of a mentorship helping the other guide itself into the core of themselves and to the point of release
[0:01 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: no manipulation can allow that
[0:01 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: its not you helping there is no mentor
[0:02 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Like changes would be so quick and would be so drastic
[0:02 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: its consciousness reflecting itself through you
[0:03 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Consciousness awakening itself thru someone else
[0:03 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Consciousness awakening itself in someone else thru someone else
[0:04 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[0:04 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: And it is an experience it's not a conversation per se
[0:04 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It's like a virus expanding
[0:05 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: But instead of virus is consciousness
[0:05 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: You're infected with consciousness and it's a matter of time to expand
[0:05 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It could take the form of conversation
[0:05 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Or bodywork
[0:05 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Or anything that‚Äôs needed at that moment in time
[0:06 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: And it's intelligent of their own so will guide the host onto what they need to be from that point onwards
[0:06 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: üòÇ
[0:06 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[0:06 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I‚Äôm
Climaxing üòÇ
[0:07 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Why ppl create modalities
[0:07 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It is similar to all medicine plants experience when the transmutation happens inside of the person and its very physical and it take any form
[0:07 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: To be able to commercialize it
[0:07 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: No babe. We're the next thing
[0:07 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Consciousness had to find their way up into the next thing into the next thing and this will only resonate with which it does
[0:07 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Whom*
[0:09 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yesss
[0:09 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yessssss that why we need to break free of that system
[0:10 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Ppl prefer to sit and talk to themselves for hours for each belief or we just turn this light on and kaboom an explosion of energy flow that moves it the way the same cos mic universe wants it in an instant
[0:10 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Into the beingness of who you are
[0:10 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yessssss
[0:12 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
[0:13 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Fuck
[0:14 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It was like giving birth just now
[0:15 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Cathartic
[0:18 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes I had a blank state
[0:21 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Life‚Äôs seems like a distraction right now I would like to be somewhere were I could be channeling constantly
