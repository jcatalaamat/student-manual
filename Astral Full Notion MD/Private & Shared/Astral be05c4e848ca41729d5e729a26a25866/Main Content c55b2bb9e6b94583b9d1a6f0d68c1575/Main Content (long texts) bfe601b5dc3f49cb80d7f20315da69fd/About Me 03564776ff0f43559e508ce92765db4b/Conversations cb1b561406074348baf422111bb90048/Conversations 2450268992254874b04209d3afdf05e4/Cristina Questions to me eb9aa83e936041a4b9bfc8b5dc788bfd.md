# Cristina Questions to me

[4:33 pm, 30/11/2020] Cristina Cooper: Being you, changing the world by Dr Dain Heer
[4:33 pm, 30/11/2020] Cristina Cooper: Is this a contribution to me? Light/heavy
[4:36 pm, 30/11/2020] Cristina Cooper: Be willing to be vulnerable, destroy and uncreated any decisions, judgements, expectations, separations and rejections about the thing in question and then ask:  If I choose this what will this create in 5 years? If I don't choose this what will this create in 5 years?
Expansion/contraction/vision/awareness - what do you perceive with this question, rather than looking for the "right answers".
[4:37 pm, 30/11/2020] Cristina Cooper: Over time it gets quicker to just get a sense of the energy of light or heavy
[4:39 pm, 30/11/2020] Cristina Cooper: What do I desire to create? Get clear about the energy even if you don't know exactly what this looks like. You can then also ask, if I choose this xxx will this contribute to what I desire to create? Even if it doesn't make sense...
[4:43 pm, 30/11/2020] Cristina Cooper: After closing a portal things can seem very different and unfamiliar, rather than making it wrong and looking for a way or reference point for it to seem familiar again (by opening another portal) why not explore what this newness is and what new  space it creates for awareness. If it's not working for you, you can always go back to what you did before.
[4:45 pm, 30/11/2020] Cristina Cooper: I find the light/heavy tool a great compass if you're willing to be vulnerable and surrender to what it is rather than assuming smthg should be heavy or light.
[4:47 pm, 30/11/2020] Cristina Cooper: Your limitations don't stop you, no-one else can stop you, but your choices do.
[4:47 pm, 30/11/2020] Cristina Cooper: Each choice creates possibilities, but each choice is only good for 10 seconds. So many things have happened in the universe after 10seconds ü§£.
[4:49 pm, 30/11/2020] Cristina Cooper: Give yourself permission to keep choosing, to choose the same or choose different.
[4:50 pm, 30/11/2020] Cristina Cooper: If you could never do anything wrong and never fail, what would you choose in this moment?
[4:52 pm, 30/11/2020] Cristina Cooper: Lastly, if I choose this will it create greater for us? If I don't choose this will it create greater for us? (me+everyone+planet or whoever...)
[4:53 pm, 30/11/2020] Cristina Cooper: Phew, thumb needs a martini now....üç∏üëçüòÇ‚ù§üåà

[8:00 pm, 06/10/2020] Cristina Cooper: Hello lovely, better questions to ask are 1. Does it work for me? And, what am I aware of?  2. Access doesn't require belief structures. For me, witnessing is different from perceiving, which is a tool of awareness.
And, there are others, such as knowing, being and receiving.

Awareness doesn't require feeling, sensation, emotion though these are more gross or lower harmonic tools that can lead to awareness. If you know something, you know it - it isn't necessary to feel it and to experience it through the body. If all awareness has to come through the body it's pretty limited, and restricts consciousness.

Ultimately, all the difference we can be is just a choice. People have to choose difference if they want to create that in their lives. All the responsibility lies with ourselves and not the other/healer/guru...
We can only contribute what can be received. All else is unkindness.

As much as possible I cultivate being no point of view with full engagement of whatever energy will contribute when working with a client. Awareness is always there if we engage with it. It's usually very clear to me when someone has chosen to bring new possibilities into their life.

I don't use the word witness anymore - for me it engenders a sense of separation - as if I am an island observer, which is not the truth for me. I perceive all sorts of things happening on lots of different levels, less linear, multiple planes of reality.

I don't believe we are born or brought up lacking anything that an external creator can give to us. I don't believe in separation. I believe we hold all the keys to our own universe within, in our own godly life force energy. And at the same time, this does not make us god. We create our lives by choosing to harness the benevolent cosmic energies rather than waiting for any spirit guide or plant to tell us what to do. Any other being, with or without a body, who tells us what to do is a demon that will willing take the power we are giving away, so that they too can create on this plane.

Yet, it isn't true that the infinite beings that we are always get our way. That would mean we are caught up in the rightness of our choices, rather than being beyond right and wrong. Choice creates possibilities and then we choose again.

How marvelous life is.

Thank you for your question. It's an epic reply but you inspired me. üòä
