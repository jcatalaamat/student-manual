# Nina - channel and creativity - ego

[9:30 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Thank you for the class but once I began my body wanted to do a complete different thing and it's been following the energy in body points and  stretching releasing  üòòü§≠
[9:32 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Perfect üåà
[10:06 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I had a dream where we were dancing and the mouvement was like me back bending until my heart opened widely and you were holding me . Very sweet feeling . The other dream I was walking with a man and her daughter , the daughter was also me , next to an agitated river that‚Äôs looked like the ocean in a very old paved bridge and I had sand in my mouth . The dad was both very loving and funny and negligent and manipulative
[10:23 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: how did you know he was like that? did it remind you of anything?
[10:24 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It was a feeling , I didn‚Äôt know the people and never been to the place tho I felt it was an image of me and my dad
[10:26 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: The little girl had to carry a small boat . The dad was more busy talking to me (I was a man in the dream) than taking care of his daughter . But then when he was paying attention to her he was basically gashlighing her
[10:26 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Being extremely nice and suppressing her feelings
[10:26 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And turning everything to a joke
[10:27 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Wow this was also me . And how i gaslight myself
[10:27 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Whatttt
[10:27 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I never put this sticker shit
[10:28 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ahha
[10:28 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Hate it
[10:28 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ok i understand a lot right now
[10:28 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I felt it was very appropiate lol
[10:29 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Haha I really dislike this things that try to look like us in a cartoon way
[10:29 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: isnt this a kundalini version of me
[10:29 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Hihi this one is cute tho
[10:30 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: you haven't seen it
[10:30 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: üòÖ
[10:30 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes I did
[10:30 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that's an illusion of the mind, just like everything else
[10:30 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Today I feel extremely light and activated
[10:30 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ü•≤
[10:30 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üëΩü¶π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[10:31 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üòÇ
[10:32 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It's so awesome you get the answers just like that
[10:32 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I feel much love towards everything that you are and gratitude for your gifts and love towards myself and there is no more difference actually the love has no container and is overflowing everything
[10:32 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and you made the connection
[10:33 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Now something in the channel between us is accelerating my particules without any effort needed
[10:33 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes effort is just the truthfulness
[10:34 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it's like magic, who would say it can be so easy
[10:37 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It‚Äôs easy but also rare . I only encountered that once in my lifetime . Also intensity varies . Depends of the transmitter and the receiver . As I type that I feel like it could actually happen with anyone if needed . Now it‚Äôs like I can have an internal conversation with your consciousness
[10:37 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: welcome home sister
[10:39 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: That is the meaning of everyone lives inside of your heart
[10:39 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[10:39 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and that is why we speak with spirits, nature, angels, guides, etc
[10:40 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it's all a creation from our essence, we get the guidance from whatever the channel we choose
[10:40 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: when we learn to trust it
[10:41 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: now the funny thing is we can create any entity we want to get filtered info from üòÇ isn't that awesome. we do create the spiritual world with our particular beingness
[10:42 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes üôå that‚Äôs creativity
[10:42 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: got ur favourite cheese
[10:43 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Noooooooo ahah
[10:43 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: creativity is spirit creating thru our lense
[10:44 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or is it not? what about they say, if you dont transmit an idea you got, someone else will get it
[10:44 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or people having spoken about same song in complete different places
[10:44 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I jealous of you and of the cheese I‚Äôm going to enter kairos body to spend a bit of time there and lick the cheese
[10:44 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes I love this
[10:45 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It‚Äôs exactly that
[10:45 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: can we get specific transfers and if someone doesnt get it then someone else will?
[10:45 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: When I‚Äôm in flow I know it‚Äôs not about me
[10:45 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It‚Äôs going through me
[10:45 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Each one of my creation that has a real energy are coming through spirit
[10:45 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I guess source has infinite plans, you may be plan A but if you dont follow thru then someone else will be plan A
[10:46 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I heard a story of a poet she was working on the fields and she said she could sense the poems coming from the horizon and the had to run back home fast when the words were coming through her
[10:46 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: To b ready with a pen on her hand
[10:46 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And channel
[10:46 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: If not they would keep going
[10:47 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes someone else will catch it
[10:47 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: But not everyone will b able to transmit the essence of it
[10:48 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: With the more transparency
[10:48 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so these downloads need to be interpreted as they come right?
[10:48 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that is why so many people in pyschodelics say they could not understand everything or grasp it all as they were not 'ready'
[10:48 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so they only integrated what their consciousness level could
[10:48 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So basically the job for us is to be very clear channel so the truth can express beyond the limitations of our ego/mind
[10:48 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[10:50 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but then 2 people with similarities could channel the exact same thing? write the same poem?
[10:50 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: no I think thats when n terms of creation its getting tricky like the soul of the person will give the form and the humanity to it
[10:51 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: in terms of science its different it can b channel as it is cause ts theoric and exact
[10:52 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: in terms of unerstanding of the cosmos it would be relative to the person channeling and how much that person can perceive
[10:52 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: we're all trying to describe the undescriptible
[10:53 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: thats why what ure doing with clearing the beleifs from the past is extremely meaningful to b able to channel the future
[10:53 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and the more we learn to observe it's beauty the better we get to describe it? the more we allow it to love us the more we can express it?
[10:53 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: with no preconceptions
[10:53 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes sssssss
[10:53 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes yes yes
[10:53 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I have a question
[10:54 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes
[11:00 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: My question is falling apart as I am trying to write it, whilst clearing my judgements about the subject lol
[11:02 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yeppp
[11:02 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I feel I have an immense depth, with lots of knowledge to come up
[11:02 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: first flag, is using depth ego?
[11:03 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: just remove the I
[11:03 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: sounds like I trap, I have more depth than you do lol
[11:03 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: There is an immense depth
[11:03 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: just like more consciousness
[11:03 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: hahaha
[11:03 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: and you can access it
[11:03 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so what determines how much depth can someone access?
[11:03 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: consciousness?
[11:04 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: presence
[11:05 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: cause I dont know if consciousness is different , consciousness is
[11:05 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: its more like how much were distracted
[11:05 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: out of it
[11:05 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it's how clean is our lense
[11:05 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: there is also something about desire, purpose, will, something that in our soul doesnt want to b contented , doesnt buy into the illusion
[11:05 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes
[11:06 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: how clear is the lense yes
[11:06 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: why is someone's purpuse different than other
[11:06 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or why the medium is different
[11:06 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: there is no other
[11:07 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: its just different forms or shapes of the consciousness
[11:07 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: like were all different aspects of the same thing in the end so it would b like
[11:07 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ahha
[11:08 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: every aspect is needed
[11:09 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: from wat aspect of yourself is this question taking form
[11:09 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: we're just a piece of the puzzle but we need all to complete the puzzle?
[11:09 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes
[11:10 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: puzzle seems to rigid tho
[11:10 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: A puzzle that would be the whole universe
[11:11 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes
[11:11 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but yes, I understand what you mean
[11:12 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: are we all just grains of sand
[11:13 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes
[11:13 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and only the divine consciousness makes us play a part, for no apparent reason?
[11:13 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: the reason is consciousness itself
[11:13 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: being expressed
[11:14 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: here there is something beyond words maybe your consciousness can allow you to sense it
[11:15 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: something around evolution consciousness is taking us as a host in order to evolve
[11:16 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that is why there is no control, even when we think there is control, is just the divine intelligence being us, that is why we flow when we surrender, we get out of the way, becoming it
[11:16 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that is why there is no I
[11:16 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes
[11:16 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: so much bliss there
[11:17 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: we become the energy that the intelligence wants us to be
[11:17 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes
[11:17 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and everything that occurs around us is to shape us into that which we are needed to become
[11:17 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: for the higher purpose
[11:18 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it helps us to get in the role of the play
[11:18 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: to give it substance
[11:18 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes and here is consciousness understanding itself through the description being birthed in our conversation or consciousness needing to be expressed through words so humanity can evolve
[11:19 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: substance yes
[11:19 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so when I understand myself is because I am consciousness itself
[11:19 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: consciousness doesnt need anything tho but it has a driving force
[11:19 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: when I understand myself there is actually not me
[11:19 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes
[11:20 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: the same force that makes the plants grow and babies developp and waves waving and bodies dying
[11:21 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: when you surrender to consciousness you embrace the full spectrum of your existence
[11:23 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ok i will need at some point to go back in the conversation and save some of what has been expressed
[11:24 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so is there something like being fully enlightened?
[11:24 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if we become consciousness so much, is there anything of us left then
[11:24 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: to me its when the I disapears totally and there is only consciousness
[11:24 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes
[11:25 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or is there still our personality in the way consciousness will be expressed when we step aside
[11:25 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: but . to me . either you dissolve into the light then
[11:25 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: either you keep some of your I to b able to be like a translator
[11:26 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: like a funambule
[11:26 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: walking in between realms
[11:26 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so when buddha became enlightened, even tho he was high most of his day, there was still some I, otherwise consciousness would be the whole universal energy and would dissapear?
[11:26 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: and deliver teachings
[11:26 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: or just by your being
[11:26 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: even if it;s the body we keep, it's still us?
[11:26 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes
[11:27 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: here i dont know i feel there must be a little hint of I to hold everything together
[11:27 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: but just by sitting
[11:28 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It would be like be in such a flow that you can sing beautiful improvsed songs all day long but you're still aware somewhere it's still you
[11:28 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: because if you were not I then you would not be aware of it, it would be a blackout?
[11:28 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: the you is aware of the flow i would say
[11:28 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: * not a blackout, don't like that word, I don't understand how someone merges into the universe and has a memory if it or can it not
[11:29 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: by cleansing the lense
[11:29 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: how can we remember an out of body experience after we 'break thru' as in 'ego death' and remember what was on the other side?
[11:29 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: he would be able to sense/ feel / Understand and channel while merging
[11:30 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: is very subtle balance
[11:30 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes ok i got you
[11:30 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: keep going
[11:30 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes I get this
[11:30 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: this conversation is removing the fears of becoming it
[11:30 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but it clashes with what others have spoken about similar things
[11:31 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ego death can't be an ego death or how would we remember it?
[11:31 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: there is big mystery there something i cant quite handle right now
[11:31 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: wait
[11:31 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: that would mean we are only our ego, right
[11:32 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: unconscious channelers say they become unconscious, which means when they are back they cant remember a single thing they did
[11:32 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: but its not the truth
[11:32 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that is death
[11:32 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: idk what ppl say i cant go there its confusing
[11:32 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but people who become enlightened and leave their body, they come back and explain what they saw
[11:33 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: as long as our mind has a link to ourselves then we will remember
[11:34 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that is why they call it enlightenment in action? you become enlightened but you're not swiped away, you contained within
[11:34 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: meaning we remeber only in the mind ?
[11:34 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ah this resonates
[11:34 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that is a good question
[11:35 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I would like to believe that if I detach myself enough, I could remember your whole life
[11:35 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: consciousness is in everything, so it's about connecting to that one to see what that consciousness saw
[11:35 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes you could
[11:36 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: then unconscious channelers do it that way as a limiting belief
[11:36 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: as u said when u spoke of the akashic records of earth in your text the other day
[11:36 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or for their own choice, basicaly not feeling good enough to do it themselves so prefer to remove themelves from the equation, so their mind does not tell them they actually remember, as that's their story
[11:36 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: its like everything that ever was is and will b is existing simultaneously
[11:37 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ayyyy I cant when you speak they I get lost
[11:37 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: the point of reference cannot b they
[11:38 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes
[11:38 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ah I see
[11:38 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that's a better way of seeing it
[11:38 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ahahahah
[11:39 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it's not they, it's always I, it's always ONE
[11:39 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes so you go away from theory and enter the realm of experience so truth can b express as t is now with no reference
[11:40 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yesssss
[11:41 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so how can our mind remember that which we were not present when it happened? or that means we were?
[11:41 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or we said is that because then the akasha would speak to us?
[11:42 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: i see a movement its almost like i need to draw it
[11:42 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: its not the mind remembering
[11:42 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: the mind is only analysing the memory then to b able to translate it
[11:43 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if we merge with the whole universe, and others have said there is no I when they are there, but something is still looking, otherwise there would be no point of reference on seeing?
[11:43 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: aaaah because the memory is everything that was is and will be
[11:43 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but when we're in our bodies we identify with the parts that relate to us
[11:43 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yesyesyeyessss i know wait we go back to consciousness here consciousness observing itself through presence
[11:44 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and when we channel we access the memory of everything else and its wisdom?
[11:44 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes
[11:44 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes
[11:44 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: YES
[11:44 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that is why the more we empty ourselves the more space there is for our divine intelligence to act the best way it has for us
[11:45 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: fuck yes
[11:45 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: its not the best way it has for US
[11:45 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: its the best way point
[11:46 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: the best way for the global evolution the best way for itself as its pure harmony
[11:46 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it's the second time the word sacrifice comes up in my mind whilst speaking this now
[11:46 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: sacrifice for the highest good
[11:47 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: there's a lot of human ways of sacrifice that are not real sacrifice
[11:47 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes actually sacrifice means : make something sacred
[11:47 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: otherwise would you trade the life of 1 person to save the live of 10?
[11:47 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or is that an old punishing way of church?
[11:47 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: christianity distorded that notion
[11:48 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I thought I was going on a hike this morning, not a whole trip with you LOL
[11:49 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ahahah !!!! Ooops
[11:49 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I also had other plans
[11:49 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I did, not source
[11:49 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ;)
[11:49 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ‚ù§Ô∏èüëÅ
[11:50 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: right so
[11:50 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: sacrifice
[11:50 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Haha
[11:50 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[11:50 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: when we embody this divine consciousness, when we're on it, we sacrifice the parts of us that are not our true nature
[11:51 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and the divine intelligence does what 'its the best way point'?
[11:53 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[11:54 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I mean it has not a plan for us in particular it acts in terms of humanity, for the highest good of all
[11:55 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so we surrender to an energy that we don't yet fully embody, sacrificing a part of ourselves we don't really know what is to become something we dont really know what will be?
[11:55 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: FUK
[11:55 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: HAHAHH
[11:56 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: what a treat
[11:56 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: while doing that . You become an explorer of all this uncertainty and unknown
[11:56 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üòÇüòÇ
[11:56 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And you try to give it a form
[11:56 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: why do we do it?
[11:57 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Because it‚Äôs the only way
[11:57 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: quite a dictatorism?
[11:57 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I am having the best philosophical morning ever right now
[11:58 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: beautiful shapes and colours in your reality
[11:58 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: You can go avoid it and then loose a lifetime of evolution
[11:59 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Like most of us do
[11:59 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Maybe also it‚Äôs like this if consciousness is able to express through you the highest truth then this truth exists and helps the whole humanity to evolve
[11:59 am, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Like
[11:59 am, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I do agree, but it actually feels impossible not to follow thru, like it is more painful to remain the same than actually open up, which is in our core nature, but almost feels evil, what force would make that happen?
[0:00 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or is it just a few that reach that place of motion? where we have already began moving so can't really stop anymore?
[0:00 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: once in motion forever in motion
[0:00 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[0:00 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes yes
[0:01 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but then everyone else would be in their own motion, right? everyone would be in their right place, at their right time, with whatever level of lense cleaned at that point
[0:01 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Exact
[0:01 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but our work would still influence them
[0:01 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[0:01 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but only because it was planned like that on the first place
[0:02 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that is why we don't awaken before we do
[0:02 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I don‚Äôt know about the plan but there is something about the speed
[0:02 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and we can't run faster than we are able to when we're on that point, so there's no point on doing extra practice, xtra meditation, if it really doesnt come from inside, otherwise is projection and ego trying to do its own self assessment about the situation
[0:02 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: About that motion
[0:03 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So the only thing that you would need to do is to b dedicated to clearing the pense
[0:03 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Lense
[0:03 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that is why the key is beingness, where we discover what we are and how we be
[0:04 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: instead of following teachings that say how the path is, because that part of the path may be ahead of us or even not of our interest at all for our path
[0:04 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: why do we awaken on the first place unless it's in someone's agenda?
[0:05 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes BUT there is wisdom of the past that is influencing all forms of thought and because they existed they allow us to thing further
[0:05 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: AND there are tools to b able to clean the lense .
[0:05 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes, and the magic of this is that because is already on our energy fields, we may not need to access it all again consciously to actually feel its effects
[0:05 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes totally
[0:06 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: luckily we dont need to build a screwdriver everytime we want to screw a screw
[0:06 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So you can effortlessly access the information you need
[0:06 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Without needing to be a scholar
[0:06 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or use a fridge without having to understand how it works
[0:06 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I like when you go back to your Ingenior mind
[0:06 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ü§ó
[0:07 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: to what extent can we not know how something works until it looses value?
[0:07 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if we only have electric tools and the electricity fails, we cant build at all
[0:07 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Whaaat wait let me read that a few times
[0:08 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Or can you reformulate with less m√©taphore
[0:08 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so consciousness evolves
[0:08 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: AHAHHA
[0:08 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: which means maybe we dont need to understand the vedas anymore to keep evolving consciousness
[0:09 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I dont like this example because talks about spiritual specifics, that's why I preferred the other one
[0:09 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I dont want to disgrace the vedas or say its not useful to read them
[0:09 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ahhh yes no not at all . For the mind it could be a key but for the consciousness itself it‚Äôs just an interpretation
[0:10 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if the vedas energy is already in the earth akasha and envolving us, means that in a base level we already have them on our system, so maybe it's not so important to know them by heart like they had to do in the past, to be able to maximize evolution
[0:10 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes here I follow you 100 %
[0:11 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It‚Äôs in the collective already so there is no evolution in knowing the vedas by heart
[0:11 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Only pleasure of the ego/ mind
[0:11 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Plus if you want to channel whatever IS
[0:12 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It‚Äôs much better not to be mind full of previous conceptions
[0:12 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Like for artists if you know all the work of all the artists of the world you are cursed cause you can just copy
[0:14 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: So I guess if we have electric screwdriver and it doesnt work anymore, we either go to the manual and fix it or we go to a mechanical screwdriver and make it and use it, and at least that way move forward? would that mean there are some essential knowing that is best to always keep, or leave it to the moment when something fails?
[0:14 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: like for example, a car, has so many parts, is there more important parts to know or more important to know all the parts/
[0:14 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: The intelligence will lead you to the parts you need to know
[0:14 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And understand
[0:15 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: maybe that's why the new electric cars are more difficult to fix without this machine that knows all about it, its expensive but requires less knowledge from the mechanic if it has it, as it tells you where it fails
[0:15 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So you don‚Äôt loose energy in knowing things that have no use for your experience
[0:16 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It‚Äôs just about being attentive
[0:16 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Like if you keep meeting a certain kind of people or bumping into the same author
[0:16 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: You might want to give it more attention
[0:17 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Or the calling like you felt called to theta and learned all the shit so you could transcend it and access deeper
[0:18 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: In the end all are diff√©rents aspects of the same form so by understanding a part of it you understand whole of it
[0:18 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ahahah
[0:19 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: is there a highest plan?
[0:20 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Evolution
[0:20 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and if we can know everything that was, is and will be, wouldn't we know exactly what will happen? how deterministic is the universe and how free will does really allow things to be different?
[0:20 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And eventually, decay , and more evolution like something spinning around his axis while going forward
[0:20 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I like this answer, evolution of consciousness across the universes
[0:21 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[0:21 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: That‚Äôs exactly it
[0:21 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Evolution of consciousness across the universes
[0:21 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if consciousness expands all the way info the infinite future, wouldnt it already have grasped all possible answers?
[0:21 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It does and all
Potentials coexist
[0:21 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: That‚Äôs why there is no determinism
[0:22 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: past and future affects each other and funnily enough there's a quantum theory where past does not mean it comes before future
[0:22 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes and hopefully we are as a collective connecting more and more to that truth
[0:22 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Which will transform our reality
[0:22 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: In mind blowing ways
[0:23 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: all potentials coexist, I need a deep breath with that one
[0:26 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yessssss isn‚Äôt it
[0:27 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Okay I changed my loation there was a light spot on the garden, much nicer temperature now
[0:29 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Maybe we exist only because keiro is dreaming us
[0:29 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Maybe even having a hike now will allow all that to infuse and then be expressed in new ways ?
[0:30 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I am not saying I won't hike, but I won't do it until I am doing it
[0:30 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: HAHAH
[0:31 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: fuck I love all that inside I‚Äôm dancing in excitement and joy how great is thattttt
[0:31 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes and what else is possible ha ü§©
[0:33 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Everything
[0:33 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I feel very good
[0:33 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: We have expressed so much that needed to be expressed
[0:35 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: There is this author, Alice Bailey
[0:37 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I got interested because there was a occultism school about her
[0:37 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: she channeled many books
[0:38 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: you need to open the file that is called index.html, works as a website
[0:38 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: in laptop
[0:38 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yesterday I began writing how i got into theta, and in the midst of my tears i went into quantum physics, and when i was reading quantum info online found the cosmic rays which is cosmic radiation
[0:39 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and that reminded me of her, so went into check what she wrote about the rays
[0:39 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and discovered what they call rays is angels or some concept
[0:39 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so felt like I was being called to disguise something in her bibliography
[0:41 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ohhhhh yesssss
[0:41 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: This
[0:41 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: there are also in this website that's the official website now [https://www.lucistrust.org/online_books/welcome_obooks_website](https://www.lucistrust.org/online_books/welcome_obooks_website)
[0:43 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Thank you I‚Äôm going to dig there it‚Äôs so aligned with whatever I‚Äôm researching at the moment and channeling through the story that ‚Äôm writing
[0:43 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I need to Dance all that and integrate in my cells
[0:44 pm, 13/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I shall continue my adventure today
[0:44 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Do
[0:45 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ok wait I need to know about these rays and angels
[0:45 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: You know it‚Äôs in his dark materials also at one point
[0:46 pm, 13/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I feel so good it‚Äôs so fast I need to slow it down so it‚Äôs dilating and not dilapidated
