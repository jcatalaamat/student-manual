# the aftermath - illusion of knowing -  science creates spirituality - summary of the week - creating tools - engineering spirituality

[6:54 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: What‚Äôs fake
[7:00 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: My spirituality. What if I acrually don't believe in anything but an inner power and no other entities other entities are all a product from our projection and therefor not exist. No more value to an angel than an imaginary friend. Only the amount of people that bought into it and they beliefs gave it power but is not real therefor I could make up a whole theory myself the one I'd like
[7:01 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Or sth of the likes
[7:01 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: If everything is a projection then why do I buy into the one that others talk about I make up the one that works for me
[7:01 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: But then we can't say it's real
[7:02 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: The only real thing I can assure about is me and even that is questionable
[7:02 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: And everything becomes very scientifically and spiritual is just the product of what is
[7:02 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: We call spiritual to the product of what science is. Spirituality is applied science
[7:03 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Science gives a framework and spiritual is the word we create with it
[7:03 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: üîîü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[7:03 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I am not sure of what I said or say
[7:03 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üåà
[7:04 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It also feels like ditching everything that got me there even when I sometimes ask for contribution from aspect of it (creator, spirit guides, etc) or at least until today. But I guess I can change opinion anytime no prob
[7:04 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Spirituality needs to be like believing in all those stuff ?
[7:04 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Creator is just the shared molecule consciousness in all that is
[7:05 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Spirit is what we made it to make it human but reality is not human
[7:05 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: The universe is not human
[7:05 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üåàüåà
[7:05 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: So spirituality has to be fucking weird shit and mostly maths
[7:05 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üåàüåàüåàüåà
[7:06 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: What if spirituality was not at all believing on all those creation
[7:06 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Creations
[7:07 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: What if it was much more simple
[7:07 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Spirituality is the love for yourself and the recognision of your connection to all that is
[7:07 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
[7:07 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: But that connection is made thru the field and the molecules and atoms
[7:08 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: This connection is explained by science spirituality makes it human
[7:09 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Or makes it sweet and loving or compassionate
[7:09 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Fuck this always .
[7:09 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[7:10 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: The truth is we don't know we keep using words to describe that which we don't know and what which gives us a sense of peace and balance
[7:10 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Even if we speak about God we can't understand why ha sit always been there
[7:11 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Understand?
[7:11 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Because we can't comprehend infinity
[7:11 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: We understand with the mind
[7:11 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: But we can experience it
[7:11 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: We can't understand something infinite
[7:12 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: No we can‚Äôt
[7:12 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: We experience something we don't even know if that's what we refer to when we come back lol
[7:12 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: But do we need to?
[7:12 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And does it matter
[7:12 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: We say 'I experienced the infinite' is that true?
[7:12 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: That we know or not that we can prove this or that
[7:12 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: What‚Äôs truth ?????
[7:12 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Good point
[7:13 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Truth is what is
[7:13 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ?
[7:13 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Maybe no
[7:13 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So if it was for you then it‚Äôs true
[7:13 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: You are the truth
[7:13 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I am my own truth
[7:13 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[7:13 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: That's why we live in my reality
[7:13 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Hahaha we all live in our own reality
[7:14 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I don't even know if you are just the product of my imagination i can only see my point of view
[7:14 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[7:14 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: The rest is imagined/created/seen which is alk the same as made up
[7:14 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I think I‚Äôm real ü§îüòÜ
[7:15 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I think so I‚Äôm real
[7:15 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Yes but to me
[7:15 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: All that exists I perceive and it all process in my brain
[7:15 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Even you
[7:15 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[7:15 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: And happens the same for you
[7:15 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: But you will never be me
[7:15 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Nor be in my point of view
[7:16 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: So how do you know
[7:16 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: That's why our life is about us and no one else
[7:16 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I can imagine what your life or point of view is but choosing it to be real is my own personal choice
[7:16 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Same as believing in God or not
[7:17 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It helps me to connect to everything and be more compassionate and have a happier life? Cool
[7:17 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: But I'm making it up. I don't really know.
[7:18 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Does God exist? Idk. Does it make me feel happier to think so? Yes. Then I choose to believe but truth is I make thst up so it fits in my how I want my live to be like
[7:18 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Knowing is a trap
[7:19 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: The human trap
[7:19 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It‚Äôs separation
[7:19 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: You mean that the only thing that matters is being?
[7:19 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[7:19 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And also
[7:20 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: If we could transform knowing in trusting
[7:20 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: How much more humble would we be
[7:21 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: With being more humble how could we transform the world
[7:21 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I don't think people are in the knowing they are in the believing
[7:22 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I really don‚Äôt think so
[7:22 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It‚Äôs quite the opposite
[7:22 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: We are in a world of intellect
[7:22 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Of facts
[7:22 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Of what‚Äôs tangible or not
[7:22 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Of wanting to know possess understand dominate
[7:23 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: There is no knowing
[7:23 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Any knowing is a belief
[7:23 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I know you - I believe I know you
[7:23 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: There is the illusion of knowing
[7:23 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I know how planets move - I believe I know it with the data sets we have had for this time
[7:24 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: So the key from here onwards is consciousness
[7:24 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Consciousness is not God
[7:24 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: There is no god. We all things together are God. All things together are consciousness. Now I get what access said everything and everyone
[7:25 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
[7:25 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: But that's only because quantum physics says we affect each other
[7:26 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Because our particles remember touch and can alter each other even if long distance is between
[7:26 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I want to go back to what you questioned about knowing but didn't know how to pick it up for more can u say sth about it
[7:27 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I said that knowing created the illusion of separation- or more precisely the desire to know
[7:27 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Knowing is related to the intellect
[7:27 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: To the mind
[7:28 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: We stopped being and we started to explain every phenomenon
[7:28 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So we could take control over what outside of us
[7:29 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And I said about knowing in opposite to trusting (which then you transformed into believing
[7:29 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Trusting and believing are not the same
[7:29 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Is knowing relating to the mind?
[7:29 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I‚Äôm talking of intuitive knowledge
[7:29 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[7:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Does consciousness know?
[7:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: No
[7:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Consciousness is
[7:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: How can you be aware of yourself without knowing it
[7:31 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I think so I know
[7:31 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: So consciousness is not aware of itself
[7:31 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I have an intellect
[7:31 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: No that‚Äôs why it needs humans
[7:31 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ‚Äú‚ÄùNeeds‚Äù‚Äù
[7:31 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: What are tools of awareness?
[7:32 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: What do you mean
[7:35 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I guess it's what you said there's an illusion of knowing?
[7:38 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Idk
[7:38 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I can‚Äôt connect to her wording atm
[7:38 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Apologies
[7:38 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: No pb
[7:38 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It just sounds thst when you try to ditch knowing it comes from a place of hurt
[7:38 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: If humans are not getting sth is their own perception
[7:38 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I don‚Äôt ditch knowing
[7:39 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It would be like saying love is not real because people confuse it with lust and that's not love
[7:39 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I just bring it back where - to me - it belongs . Not on the throne
[7:40 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Being is the throne
[7:40 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: But as a fonction of the human brain
[7:40 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[7:41 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I said belief - > knowing - > being
[7:41 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Where is trust fitting in here or how is it relating for you?
[7:41 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: The human knowing is not truth because everything thst is not being is subject to being changed
[7:42 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Just like beliefs
[7:42 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It's a stronger level of belief
[7:42 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Trust ourselves // trust the harmony // trust the flow
[7:42 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: A beingness remains it's own beingness even if it changes is part of beingness
[7:43 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: But your knowing here has another energy
[7:43 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: That the knowing I was taking about
[7:44 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Yes that's what I meant that's not real knowing
[7:44 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[7:44 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It's like comparing families that 'love' but don't really do because it's all mixed up with all other stuff
[7:45 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Hm
[7:46 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: OK you're talking about the race for knowledge
[7:46 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: üòÇ Just got it
[7:46 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ü§Ø
[7:46 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ü§ó
[7:46 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: And that trust would
[7:46 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes I‚Äôm taking the desire to KNOW if god exist
[7:46 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Or aliens
[7:47 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And trust would b the real knowing
[7:47 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Well that's because trust is the loving response
[7:47 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Wanting to know is fear based
[7:48 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I don't want to believe in God because if I'm wrong then I am... Blablabla
[7:48 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: So it's the fear of getting it wrong
[7:48 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: That makes us want to know
[7:48 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Voil√†
[7:48 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: So we can relax
[7:48 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: 'I know this to be true therefor stop bothering me with your questions'
[7:48 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üòÇ
[7:48 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Or 'science hasn't proved it so they don't know your god to exist therefor stop making me question my whole life'
[7:49 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Or ‚ÄúI trust this‚Äù it‚Äôs good for me , I feel the truth of it and I don‚Äôt need it to be validated by anyone
[7:49 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: For it to b real
[7:50 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Yes
[7:50 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: 'I don't care if God exists or not because when I choose to believe it then I live happier, even if it weren't to be'
[7:50 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Even Flandes in Simpson discovers God doesn't exist but he destroys the proof so people can remain happy
[7:51 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: üòëüòÇ
[7:51 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üòÇ
[7:52 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGBxUNaQI1I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGBxUNaQI1I)
[7:52 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Something in believing seems blind as in trusting it‚Äôs active and with discernment
[7:52 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I remember this episode
[7:53 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üòÇ
[7:53 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes believe gives space for not existence and trust... whats that energy?
[7:55 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Let me present you the Googled definitions of ‚Äúbelief‚Äù and ‚Äútrust.‚Äù ‚ÄúBelief‚Äù is a noun which means: (a) an acceptance that a statement is true or that something exists or (b) something one accepts as true or real; a firmly held opinion or conviction. On the other hand, ‚Äútrust‚Äù can either be a noun or verb. As a noun, ‚Äútrust‚Äù means ‚Äúa firm belief in the reliability, truth, ability, or strength of someone or something.‚Äù
[7:55 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Trust there is an energy of choice a guidance inherent to existence itself
[7:55 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: As we will look at the above definitions, there is nothing much different about ‚Äúbelief‚Äù and ‚Äútrust.‚Äù However, if one would think philosophically, we can say that ‚Äútrust‚Äù holds a greater meaning than ‚Äúbelief.‚Äù Just like what other people say, your belief might only be lip service. You can easily say to someone that you believe him, but when you need to say that you trust him, it needs a deeper consideration. ‚ÄúBelief‚Äù is the product of the mind, while ‚Äútrust‚Äù is the product of both the mind and heart.
[7:56 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: much more concise than my answer
[7:56 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Damn this is turning me on at
[7:56 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Af
[7:57 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: When you are believing, it is just like you are expecting to earn something; but if you are trusting, you are surrendering all of yourself no matter what the outcome is ‚Äì for the better or worse. However, without believing, you cannot reach the stage of trust. Belief is already halfway to trust. You only need to do it in action. If you don‚Äôt stop believing and hold firm in your convictions, the door of trust will open right before you.
[7:58 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yessss
[7:58 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Are you writing this right now ?
[7:58 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: no babe

[7:59 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
[8:00 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So this morning during my meditation something came up about the energy every word carries and how the next step was to really integrate that energy
[8:00 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So when used in a healing the word means what it actually means
[8:01 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that is why you remove 1/8 of your sentences in whatsapp LOL
[8:01 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And that‚Äôs why also I‚Äôm triggered by the too much wording almost automatic of theta and other modalities and how in the end most of us will use words that‚Äôs don‚Äôt really understand
[8:02 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ü§™
[8:02 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yap

[8:06 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and idk how access would just say ' all that is would u destroy? like seems like we still need some consciousness awareness of some sort?
[8:06 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and it was beautiful, she was breaking into tears so quickly because of the mission
[8:06 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: u should have seen me in IA

[8:07 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes of course it‚Äôs very powerful I just looking how it can be more essential more simple
[8:07 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes
[8:07 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: access removes the drama yes
[8:07 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Also those 2 woman are so graceful
[8:08 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or most of the drama because you pick the energy and release without having to rbing it to conscious awareness
[8:08 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes but then access use all this bunch of words also idk I need to look more in it
[8:09 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: whenever have 7min [https://drdainheer.com/free/the-clearing-statement/](https://drdainheer.com/free/the-clearing-statement/)
[8:09 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: think i sent it
[8:09 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Transform transmute etc . If you talk to someone that doesn‚Äôt know what your saying you may sound smart but they will still miss some of it
[8:09 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: for now I began using the transcend & transform but its true, I mean, we turn into collective belief
[8:09 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: like
[8:09 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: we know
[8:09 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: feng shui is as bullshit as theta is
[8:10 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: now, are we going to go against what millions believe?
[8:10 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if it can bring us good?
[8:10 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: KABOOM
[8:10 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: my crown is pulled by a thread
[8:11 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or what is a universal truth? do they exist?
[8:11 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: is a law of the universe a truth?
[8:12 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ü§ó
[8:12 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: The laws of the universe are true, yes . There is universal truth
[8:12 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: the guy who danced to make rain was not making rain but the belief of everyone that he would, then rain happened
[8:13 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[8:13 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: now is better to make rain by snapping the fingers, easier no complication
[8:13 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so we basically go to what is more comfortable that is still fun for us
[8:13 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so its not boring to do it
[8:16 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but access uses the crazy statement and says 'well if you dont get it is fine it still works' which I guess its part of the catch of access, that you believe that even if you dont know it but you say it then it works, which is maybe better than saying transcend and transmute which they can try to grasp consciously
[8:16 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: vianna said you your client needs to believe 4% and you the rest
[8:16 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: because youre the 100d monkey
[8:16 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes a part of me buys into that
[8:16 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so your belief is much more powerful
[8:17 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And another is like hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[8:17 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes I understand Nina it took me a few months to get into the acces
[8:17 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I did the bars training in october
[8:17 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and forgot about it for a few months and then...
[8:17 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it began exploding from within
[8:17 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: not the clearing statement per se
[8:17 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but at the same time, when i use it i connect to the collective and their beliefs and their ways
[8:18 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: much better than connecting to a belief system of 4000 years ago attached to plenty of entities that can harm me
[8:18 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes yes yes I am not questioning the energy of it I‚Äôm just wondering how it could b more simple more essential
[8:19 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes true, me too
[8:19 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: u dont need a clearing statement if you believe that you dont need it
[8:19 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but you want ppl to beleive it to
[8:19 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and to transfer it
[8:19 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes . It‚Äôs like spells , in the end
[8:20 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but if we work with pure energy, if we're dong something from another dimension, how much are we to break with what has been done till now
[8:20 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: today i worked to release tons of shit, didnt really need to know what it was,just brought up a situation memory that was in my life that limited me in some way, no needed to know what was relating to or what screwed me in it, and i only pushed it up with the kundalini rising
[8:21 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and i trusted that was enough
[8:21 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: How can I always create my own clearing statement that will resonate with the person and doesn‚Äôt need to come from anywhere else than the source
[8:21 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: when i had done 100 different situations
[8:21 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: i was like, how much of this is real, can it be this easy
[8:21 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but if i dont doubt it, I went thru 100 different situations in my life and released them in less thn 1 hour, at the speed of light
[8:21 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: wasnt super comfortable
[8:21 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but it was also ecstatic
[8:22 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è love the energy of it
[8:22 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: do we need to create a collective consciousness around what we do?
[8:23 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: No just connect to the truth of the universe
[8:23 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: like the idea of repeating the same thing is discipline, routine, and creating a ritual/habit,
[8:23 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but then we're talking that whoever learns needs to learn
[8:23 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: its not like
[8:23 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: come do a course
[8:23 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: here is your certificate
[8:23 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: its come
[8:23 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: fucking freak the fuck out of your being and awaken motherfucker
[8:23 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and now you go as an enlightened being do the same
[8:23 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: üîîüòÇ
[8:24 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: HAHAHAHA
[8:24 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: delicious
[8:25 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I just bursted into laughter
[8:25 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: YES
[8:26 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: üòÇ
[8:26 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that sounds BIG
[8:26 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that's why we felt can it be master/recipient
[8:26 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but if this needs to be 1 on 1
[8:26 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: its like classic and special, but is it most performing?
[8:26 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: A part of it is 1 on 1
[8:27 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: The real deal I may say but also there is something that I loved in theta is the idea that when you witness the healing of another tu also heal
[8:27 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: See where I‚Äôm heading ?
[8:29 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so the 1 on 1 is some sort of initiation
[8:29 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[8:29 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: like a classic attunement
[8:29 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[8:29 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: is the giving diksha
[8:29 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: awakening the kundalini from the recipient
[8:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[8:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: thats super awesome
[8:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: very fucking cool
[8:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It is
[8:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ü•≥üòÇ
[8:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[8:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: love that my language has drastically changed
[8:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüöÄüß®
[8:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Me too
[8:31 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: well access says, and we said I believe the other day, there is no healing?
[8:31 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: we're whole and complete, is only ego mind that believes its broken because its bought into that idea
[8:31 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: you dont heal the ego mind
[8:31 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: you lift the illusion
[8:32 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: YESSSSSSSSSSSS
[8:32 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: This is it
[8:33 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: That‚Äôs what‚Äôs makes it essential and simple and radical
[8:33 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And true
[8:35 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Well done, prince
[8:36 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and so
[8:36 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: clearing statement in access does not require witness
[8:36 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: only knowing
[8:37 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so u make a command and go to toilet to make a shit and all good
[8:37 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or eat a fucking date
[8:37 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: no problem
[8:37 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üòÇ
[8:37 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: you witness in theta and u feel overwhelmed with energies and u are there kind of fuck how long do we need to stay here witnessing
[8:37 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: is god not faster
[8:37 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and then there is what is happening to me/us
[8:38 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: i can make a clear statement both from theta or access
[8:38 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and i get the rush
[8:38 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: As in the end time is also an illusion cause all is happening right in the instant
[8:38 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and sometimes depending on the sentence and how 'important'? whats the word? how deep or how CORE it is for me, then I get a longer discharge
[8:38 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes that‚Äôs what I mean
[8:38 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: theta says healing is instant in the energy world but the physical world is slower so may take longer
[8:40 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[8:42 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so
[8:42 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: what is all that about
[8:42 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: do we witness
[8:42 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: do we not
[8:43 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: why our stuff has a period of time
[8:43 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: are we choosing it because it turns us on and why not
[8:43 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: is it just always easier to have some sort of proof
[8:43 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: what happens if we work on someone and nothing physical appears to happen?
[8:44 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Wooooooottt
[8:45 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ahha
[8:45 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: This is next episode
[8:45 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I just arrived home
[8:47 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: hahaha
[8:48 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: well I mean theta is about witnessing and ppl releases in class. access clear statement does not do that, it puts it like in engineering we would call it a universal processing queue as waiting to be processed and you get the effects when the universe has processed it
[8:48 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: now, access does the bars, which puts fingers on 32 points on your head, supposed to release stuff, and it does work
[8:48 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Cool
[8:49 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and then we have all the ESB ESC and SOP
[8:49 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: There is def something like bodywork involved
[8:49 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: which I think 2 of them are laying down on table
[8:49 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or sitting
[8:49 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: whilst moving hands following intuiition
[8:49 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and people getting spasms and jerks and shit
[8:49 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I did that at my retreat , hands plus theta
[8:49 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: which is apparently similar to what we do
[8:50 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[8:50 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes but now I can text you or be present anywhere and u get the discharge too, and also access has gone online when it was a hands on procedure ü•≥
[8:50 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so yes, we can use hands
[8:50 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: we dont need to
[8:50 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and we can use verbal stuff
[8:51 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: That‚Äôs the point . If it turns us on , it‚Äôs the good way
[8:52 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but is it innate of this sort of work
[8:52 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I‚Äôm going to eat keep going if needed I‚Äôll go through after
[8:52 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: is it the conscious proof we need that sth happens but we dont need to know it consciously!
[8:53 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if you come and i have spasms at least i know you did something fucking weird no one else did so it must work and I also feel better
[8:53 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: i dont need to know consciosuly we worked on this or that or the other but trust that things will open
[8:53 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: KABOOM
[8:53 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ü•≥
[8:53 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: üß®üß®üß®üß®
[8:54 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I say it because sometimes I mean i got for long hours self working and its like very intense, so sometimes I ask is there any way where it's even easier
[8:54 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: because it feels like huh a little exhausting to be in that continum
[9:20 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: [https://delicioushealing.com/onions-or-nucleated-spheres/](https://delicioushealing.com/onions-or-nucleated-spheres/)

[9:29 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So , she is using like 4 different modalities
[9:29 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It‚Äôs about adding more and more stuff
[9:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I think she's just promoting access
[9:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but is explaining bits of how it works
[9:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: she has pleny of methos yes
[9:30 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: i just saw
[9:31 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: How can we subtract instead of adding
[9:32 pm, 16/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ok i ate too much üòÇ

[9:50 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: sky told me to get in contact with one of the guys from here, time ago, so i would get a one on one for channeling, never ended up doing it
[9:50 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but she was encouraging and seeing that what i had to bring encompassed a lot more than theta
[9:50 pm, 16/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: she said to me theta was my playground before going to university
