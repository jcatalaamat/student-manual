- my realisation about mountains, from being my escape, to becoming something optional, as i had my self worth, and so other options were also attracting to me, like a nap, instead of a cloudy summit, and how much fun was to descend that chimeny when it began raining, and it was all sleepery and the path was unclear

- how i began experimenting with theta healing and commanded to feel the whole planet at once and felt it
- how crazy some of my meditations were and how no one i encountered back then was able to relate, how much seizure shaking jerks I had whilst meditating and allowing the energy to move thru, how much of it felt like sexual energy because i had a distortion about sexual/creation

- how i found my power of belief - weed meditation & theta healing

- The one day I came back to my home and had that dream about my dad higher self and I found myself upside down and feeling of the energy everywhere.
- A medium age dark Indian or similar skin during stillness meditation at tushita. It swiped from bottom to top and the eyes were shaded. I had shivers all over the body for quite some time
- 21/12/19 â†’ first attempt of conscious OBE. I could feel those sensations and sound in my ear. The more I was letting go the more inside and floaty I was feeling. I first was grateful to my higher sense and that made the connection so much stronger. Then I commanded to please help me with astral Projection. Then after every little bit I would feel the energy rushes. Changing pressure and sound in ear. Then sometimes I would get distracted and I'd have a sudden body change, the higher self pushed me to re awaken me. Then I kept affirmations like I can astral project, re-entry safely, remember everything. And I would feal rushes of energy when some of these. Then after a bit i would start getting lost. Finding the thread again and continuing. At some point I felt a strong heavy weight on my chest. I thought maybe I obed outside. I was then at some point hit by a strong lightening. I could have guessed it was a re-entry that I didn't remember or something like this.
