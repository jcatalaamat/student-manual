**What am I grateful for? (What you have, Where you are, Who you love)**

- I am grateful for my sister, who’s been there supporting and being uplifted every time I have been around, who shows interest and kindness towards me and my family.
- I am grateful for my soul, for being here, for transforming my environment into the most beautiful life I’ve ever experienced.
- I am grateful for Lyra, who is about to be born, and for every experience that has led me to today.

**What is my most important task today?**

**What story-worthy moment happened yesterday?**

**How am I feeling right now?**

**What’s working right now? What could be better?**
