- Check what children need to hear with a meditation

# Vision

Children from conscious parents and curious children that access the internet find how to become magic, how to be emotional intelligent, and just teachings and learnings I would like my nice to receive as she is growing up.

# Lessons

Understand the value of each sense and emotion. What would life be without hunger? What if we didn't have to eat? And pee? Would we do anything? Do we need a drive? The first drive comes from emotions and feelings like hunger and fear and survival etc. Teach a kid why do we have each emotion and see all are valuable.
