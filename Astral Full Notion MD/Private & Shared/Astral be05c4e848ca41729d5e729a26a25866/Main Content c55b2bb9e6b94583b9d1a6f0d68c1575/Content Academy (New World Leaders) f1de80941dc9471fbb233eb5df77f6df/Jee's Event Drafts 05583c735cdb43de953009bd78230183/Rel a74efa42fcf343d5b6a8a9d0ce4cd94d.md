# Rel

> An emotion has a lifespan of 90 seconds in the brain, further than this is just a reinforcement by thoughts â†’ emotions

What do you do to change the feeling inside?

What do you want, what are the rules of the game, and how do you achieve it.

Where do you want to get to.

What weight had what already happened, what will happen and what is happening.

You can be different without destroying the relationship.

## My Non Negotiables

1. Peaceful and loving communication for important matters.
2. Commitment to the process of healing relationship.
3. I need to feel safe if a full commitment is required from me.
4. No shouting, no defensiveness, no attacking, no accusing, no guessing about future. Find the hurt and not the excuse.
5. RAIN and EMAGO

## Practices
