# Meeting Amoraleza

# Intention

- We can ve a very good asset to you to bring life, advertising, and bring people here
- Ideas, projects, building things that are great for right now
- Global vision of long term holistic evolvement of this community further from ayahuasca retreats into more holistic events
- It's for all of us to create a trust together for long term flourishing

# Notes

- Do they understand our contribution?
    - Advertising the place in Orgiva and our own Network of around 150 people
    - Getting contacts of people when they come to the events here (ecstatic dance)
    - Taking care of their Social Media that are interested in the place, posts, stories, bringing life to Amoraleza Social Media
    - Value of the events we host here that are 'free' for family & sandra
    - Heart Circle - 1/2 times a week
    - We have people waiting to book ayahuasca through us
    - We have a contact for building things here who is very experienced
    - Contribution to the children & potential contribution if they would allow us to teach them things
    - Talking to visitors to explain about the space and what's offered - inductions to people
    - It seems there are many things that are being taken for granted from their side
    - Website & Pictures & Video and realise how much work that is and the value of it
        - +-40h of website
        - +-30h pics & video
    - She asks contribution in form of our skills and she doesn't take the time for it - not our bad
    - Karlyn playing music on ceremonies & ecstatic dance & future events
    - Instruments in yurt
- They keep talking about the past issues - which is not allowing the future to come in if they decide to remain locked in past traumas
- How can they understand that we don't depend on them?
- The dynamic they have 'you buy or you leave' that has been repeated so many times by Lorenzo - and you want to create a sense of belonging - these don't match when you threaten us to go all the time
- The dynamic of changing the agreement all over the time, so we feel unsettled and having to proove ourself somehow all the time
- 100â‚¬ monthly from June, what about May? (Sandra asked, but makes no sense as we were volunteers)
- Percentage of what we make because of the space? How to clarify this? If we are residents and we pay we can't use the space in our things?
- For one-to-one's there is not a real space for therapy - and we depend on Veronika saying if the space is or not available

# Other options

- If they don't want us here we can find another place to live and we can come here every once in a while if they still want to host our events
- 

# Outcomes

- Agreement in place
- We are not here forever and we can rearrange every month about what's going on
