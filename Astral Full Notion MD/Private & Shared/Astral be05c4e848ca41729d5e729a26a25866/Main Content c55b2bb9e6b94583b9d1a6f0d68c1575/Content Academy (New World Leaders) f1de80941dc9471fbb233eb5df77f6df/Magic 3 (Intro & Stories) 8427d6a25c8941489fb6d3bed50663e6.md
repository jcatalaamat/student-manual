NINA MOORE -

Kundalini activator, Self Mastery Mentor, Space holder, 

Modalities : Kundalini yoga, Quantum healing, Movement therapy, Energy medicine ,

"Nina is a shapeshifter who believes in the fluidity of being. She offers an experience of deep reconnection with your truth, your unshakable center and what you are beyond the patterns with reprogramming tools such as Theta healing and Access consciousness. Nina trusts and shares the intelligence of the body, using touch and movement to allow somatic experiences and raise the Kundalini energy.  

In her healing sessions Nina welcomes and allows everything that you are with a spacious presence, so you can move through the judgements and constructs, witnessing your own perfection. Becoming a mirror that reflects the divinity that you embody, she is guiding you towards the unfolding of your gift. Working with the quantum field she is recalibrating your future by activating an infinity of possibilities, inviting you to enter a state of flow and synchrony. She is also using the powerful vibration of the crystal to encode cells with healing light.

Nina is a Kundalini and Hatha yoga teacher. She is leading dance journeys and channeling activations through body mudras. She is a transformational mentor, guiding you to realize yourself by expanding your consciousness. As a therapist, Nina is diving into the depths of your psyche to allow the shadows to be lit. She is speaking the words that will activate your higher potential as an invitation for you to become what you are meant to be. Nina is holding spaces of self-alchemy, creating ceremonies where she invites plant medicine as an heart opener and mind-shifter."

My journey started with a first kundalini awakening that made me loose the sense of identity. All what I thought I could hold on collapsed to reveal the illusion of reality. Lost in a maze, with no guidance, I had to turn self-destruction into healing. Becoming One was a roller coaster of emotions and I started a deep shadow work. While embodying archetypes I began channeling messages from other dimensions. Art became my therapy and I discovered the power of Love as an energy - the leading force of the Cosmos. Guided by grace in a state of flow, I entered the world of synchronicities and my nomadic life led me to the jungle of Colombia where, with the contribution of Ayahuasca, I faced the Infinity of my being and got the keys of Freedom. I was able to make sense of my existence and to let go of deeply rooted generational patterns such as addiction and obsessive behaviours. I understood that I needed to be able to integrate fully the transformation through a committed lifestyle. Yoga was the first tool that I fully embraced. Living in various ashram in India I realized the power of discipline and the fascinatingly intricated relation body-spirit. Yoga showed me how to  raise and hold the energy with a balanced state of being. Moving my  bodies through intuitive movement allowed me to unlock stored cellular trauma and approach the state of Guidance : becoming a part of the Whole, letting go of control and thinking mind. The body as a kingdom, as a pristine and mysterious land that had hidden treasures to be revealed showed me the way to Consciousness.  Becoming fascinated by the sacredness of life and how to embody fully presence to bring the light down to earth, with clarity, grace and simplicity, I stepped into a Quantum reality and aligned myself with my higher purpose, surrendering to cosmic intelligence to show me the way.

*My personal journey*

My journey started years ago when I had everything of the perfect life : a cool job in a famous production company of documentary movies, working on cool projects, living in a cool apartment in Paris, but something was still missing... I remember being sit at my computer desk, drawing Excel tables, often wondering if that was going to be my life. Deep inside, I knew there was something more… I wanted to discover, learn, move, feel…

Soon enough I quit my job, my apartment and book a one-way ticket to travel the world. On the road, from country to country,

I found myself.

Far from the office life, I shut off my rational mind, developed my intuition, started to create art again and completely changed the way I lived, connecting for the first time with my beingness. Guided by the signs and encounters, I met shamans and spiritual masters who taught me sacred music instruments and lead me to perceive a whole new invisible realm, the one of the guides and spirits.

I decided to dedicate myself to growth and learning, joining trainings and retreats, facing my past and any emotion that was coming up.

I was more alive than I had ever been.

Back in France it became obvious that I wanted to be in service of other human beings to share what brought me so much joy and peace. I started to offer one-on-ones healing sessions, group courses and retreats guiding other through their self-transformation. 

As a growth-addict and Consciousness seeker, I am constantly digging inside myself learning and unlearning with a beginner’s mind to keep on expanding. 

Certifications : Shamanic Healing (FSS - Fondation for Shamanic Studies), Sound-therapy (Gong Master Don Conreaux, tuning fork pioneer John Beaulieu, Academy of Sound Therapy, Satyam Shivam Meditation School), Quantum Healing and Past Life regression therapy (BQH, Access Consciousness Bars and Fondations, Theta Healing), Breathwork (Breathwave & Holotropic).

# Offerings

Jee Ka delivers a unique offering in personal transformation through a variety of tools like access consciousness and theta healing as well as body processes like reiki and tantrik activations directly channeled from source.

After mastering the tools that he learned he began channeling his own experience of transforming the space around the receiver into consciousness.

Jee Ka asks the receiver the right questions to activate the consciousness that the receiver is needing to become the highest version of themself. He uses a mix of his learnings in those different traditions with a touch of his own signature. By the use of language he is capable to understand the state in which the recipient is in, allowing this way to bring consciousness into the experience of the recipient. And with this, just like a flashlight pointing into the story of a person, the pattern dissolves into space. The receivers may or may not feel the energy flow depending on the level in which they find themselves, how much work they have done and how sensitive they are around energies.

His work has been claimed to be like the integration process of a DMT trip by other plant medicine facilitators. Other effects have been somatic experiences either by tears or laughter, leaving receivers in a blissful state.

His healings are never the same, as he becomes the space that the receiver needs him to be to be able to deliver the transformation that they are needing in that moment. Jee Ka  believes that the meeting between himself and the receiver is a synchronicity for both, learning in every session how to finetune his capabilities, and the receiver becomes exactly what is ready for, just like a plant medicine experience.

Jee Ka works around the beingness of all beings. He is. His beingness defines the work that he brings to the world.

He works mainly in group setting, allowing the participants to share the stage in which they are around the story in which they live, allowing receivers to relate to each other. That way when he delivers the space and the choice into one person, everyone else is expanding into their own consciousness.

He creates space and consciousness around the person's truest of their being. He does not project ideas or guesses into the receivers mind, but opens the space for new possibilities by inviting new and more expanded energy-consciousness into the field of the receiver.

He can work on one on on sessions to deliver maximum transformation for the time spent. 

In one session, the receiver may overcome a long lasting challenge that the receiver is not willing to work about anymore as it has been dragged around for too long. 

If the receiver works with Jee Ka for a longer period of time the transformation is exponential. The life of the receiver totally changes. This can be a shock for some. Some come for change but don't realize what their life can really become when fully empowered.

Jee Ka believes in the magic that everyone is. For him there are no limits into where people can get to, besides people's limits onto how much they truly want to become.

To work with Jordi, there are no requirements besides the willingness to face the Truth of themselves. Head first, the person can face their darkness and still love themselves. Jee ka delivers a no-judgement based transformational therapy. It breaks the world of duality where most people find themselves stuck in, and allows them to elevate themselves away from everything they thought they were into the being that they truly came to life to be.

In a ceremonial setting, Jordi has a variety of aspects into which he becomes

- He delivers hand on healing by gentle touch, sounds and hand gestures
- He channels sounds, spoken words and melodic songs with other guitar players and musicians. He sings about the beauty, the strength of Life and the human as the blessing that we all are. His songs are a call into living for people to awaken the magic and the light within. He makes simple songs to release the seriousness of the processes and to relax into the simplicity of beingness.
