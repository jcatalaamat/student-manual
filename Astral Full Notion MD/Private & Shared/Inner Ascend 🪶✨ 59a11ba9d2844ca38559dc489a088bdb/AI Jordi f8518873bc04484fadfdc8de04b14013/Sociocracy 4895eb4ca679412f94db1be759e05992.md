# Sociocracy

Sociocracy: The power to make the decisions lies with the peers

Quakers: Trusting that each person’s voice has the capacity to speak from the Divine

Bringing equivalency to a hierarchy

S3: sociocracy 2.0 —> it’s not a framework, it’s broken up into different pieces that you can choose when you want them 

Seven principles: 

- **equivalence**: in some situations people’s voices or decisions will matter more than others; the people that are less experience will still have their word to say
- **consent**: before doing something you make sure that there is a check-in with the relevant people; not everyone has to agree 100% to continue

In democracy you move ahead even if a large amount of people disagree

That’s not the case here

- **transparency**: not everything needs to be transparent, it means confidentiallity has to be consented to
- **accountability**
- **effectiveneess**: aking sure the job is done; different from efficiency
- **empirism**: with argument, with evidence
- **continous improvement**: learn from your mistakes, keep moving

Driver statement: an articulation of a situation that is motivating action

—> what’s happening and what’s needed

Needs are different from solutions

Touch the need, not the solution

Example:

Current reality: i am feeling tired

Desired reality: i need to focus

Driver statement: what could happen if we address this need, making clear what we want to happen

How bridge into solutions: how do we respond to these needs

We identify a need, how are we going to take responsability for that needs

4 ways (to satisfy that driver):

- action: do something
- policy agreement: example: we agree when the task need to be get done for
- role: one person can be project coordinator, and check in with everyone
- circle / group: make the team dealing with something

Navigate via tension:

Weaving the back and forth between the individual process and the collective responsability

- First you notice the tension: I feel something, i’ve detected something
- Qualify driver: is this thing relevant for the organization (or is it a pure personal thing?) —> do I drop it or do I delegate it by asking the question “whose domain?”, whose responsible for this?
- Consent to driver: is it clear? is it relevant?

—> the person might find it’s not relevant for the organisation and drop it or that it is and they’re going to decide how to respond

They might also decide that it’s not their responsability and pass it on to somebody else

My responsability ends when someone is taking on the task
So i can not forget about it until i took care of it or pass on the responsability to someone else

At some point we don’t need to share everything to the whole group and only share to the people that are responsible

And maybe once a month we open a circle with the whole group to know if there are any problem that need to be brought to the attention of the whole team

**Decision making**

- **consent to driver**: before getting to the proposal make sure everybody understrand why it’s important to act
- **present proposal**: somebody presents the proposal to the group
- **clarifying questions**: keep going around the circle until everybody understands the proposal
- **brief response**: a round of brief responses (example: thumbs ups or downs, a note out five with the fingers, quick emotional check-in)
- **harvest objections**: an objection is a reason what doing what’s proposed will be harmful to the organization; it means harmful in relation to our ability to meet our purpose
- **integrate wisdom**: maybe the solution changes or maybe we have to address some other things first before we take a decision
- **celebrate**: the decision is being made and you can celebrate
- **(consider concerns)**: you can still check for concerns that this decision might not be a good idea; maybe today we didn’t see it but tomorrow we’ll figure out that’s a bad idea; A decision is good enough for now and safe enough to try
Anything can be objected to at any point of time

The person bringing the proposal is in a position of power

So another person will be facilitating the session to distribute the power

Another one can decide how long the session will be - even if it’s a small task it distributes the power

Someone in the integration part can summarize everything that is being said for the group

The result of that process is that people that normally speak a lot become silent and the people that usually are quite speak up because they are picking up on many things that need to be said
