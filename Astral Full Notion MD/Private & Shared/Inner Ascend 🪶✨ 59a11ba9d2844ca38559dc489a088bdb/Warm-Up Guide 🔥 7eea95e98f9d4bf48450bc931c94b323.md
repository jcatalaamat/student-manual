# Warm-Up Guide ðŸ”¥

## Description

- **Why the warm-up?**
    
    It is very beneficial for our launch if people already know who you are, what you do and what your vibe will be at IA. Therefore, we would like each of us to warm up our accounts leading up to April, but already starting end of February. Because as soon as we start the pre-launch phase, your name will be mentioned. People will be excited to see who will be holding space for them soon. 
    
- **Consistent Personal Branding**
    - Use a recognizable profile picture or logo.
    - Create a branded bio that shows your expertise and your role within Inner Ascend
    - Establish a consistent visual theme for your Instagram feed.
    - Share authentically and vulnerably, so that people get to know you as you are.
    
- **Set the tone for your brand**
    - **Reintroduce yourself**
        
        Show yourself as you are, writing about you and your learnings. The easier to read and entertaining it is (either through lessons, vulnerable sharings or fun stories), the better.
        
        Examples:

        You can do this every couple of weeks, because there will always be people new to your page. Create videos or texts and keep sharing them on your feed, your stories, your highlights. 
        
    - **Tell your story**
        
        Help people get to know you and your journey. 
        
        A reel with videos from your path, a writing about a big learning, a spoken video about a life changing moment..whatever feels right for you to make them learn about you and connect. It is about being human and relatable.

    - **Share your offerings**
        
        Describe your offerings as simple and relatable as possible. 
        
        You could here create a Carousel Post on Canva:

         Or perhaps craft a video from sessions, past workshops
        
    - **Speak about your past work**
        
        Share results/ testimonials from previous clients or participants in your workshops. Either on posts or stories, adding those to your highlights. 
        
    - **Connect with your audience**
        - **Make it about them and their journey**
