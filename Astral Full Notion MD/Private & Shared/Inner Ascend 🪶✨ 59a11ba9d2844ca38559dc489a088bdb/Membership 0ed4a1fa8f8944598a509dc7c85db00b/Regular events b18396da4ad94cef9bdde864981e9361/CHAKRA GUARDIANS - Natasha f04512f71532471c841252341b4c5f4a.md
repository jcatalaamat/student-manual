Duration: 1 hour and a half

Title: CHAKRA GUARDIANS

Short description:

Every two weeks, join us for a colorful adventure through the chakra system, and meet the spirit animal whose medicine would benefit you the most to activate, reenergise and heal each one of your main energetical centers. 

Description:

INTRO

The language of the subconscious mind is one of images and symbolism. Just like a dream, a guided vision quest allows deep and powerful changes within your psyche. We are working with the symbolism of the 7 main chakras and the animal reign, put together for a meaningful healing of your whole system throughout the weeks.

WHAT & HOW

This is a guided meditation. We start with a quick sharing circle for everyone to deliver whatâ€™s present. Then we enter a relaxed meditative state, and we start the journey all the way through the heart of a specific chakra. There, we summon the animal that is willing to share with us its medicine, its strengths and qualities, those that would best serve us in activating, balancing and healing the chosen chakra. After getting familiar with it, we give thanks to the spirit animal and we come back to our senses. After a few moments of recentering, we end the session with another sharing circle, to help integrating the experience.
