Grounding 

Quick sharing 

Jordi -  progress over perfection - do not need to be perfect - compassion is giving me all the answers that I have been searching for

relaxing and taking time will give me more then take from me - clarity will come then

Balance between the both 

Increase love, transmute fear into peace 

connect more with creation and pleasure - express myself, more pleasure and joy 

what experience as a mirror for others 

Challenges - a lot of shame get rid of -maybe first accept it? 

wants a lighter view on life, more trust, more optimism

interactions questions, helps me reflect better 

wants to go into a flow state instead of pushing 

Karlyn -  listening to my intution 

much more space, no more pain in my body, no more stress

now its time to embody it 

why does my technology keep on breaking? 

is it self-sabotage or is it telling me that I need to find another way of working? or maybe even attracting people? 

is it more about slowing down, and being more connected with yourself 

listening to your intution 

How can I create space for me, without having to break my technology? 

its forcing you to integrate and recieve, it doesnt have to be shared imediatly so the beauty lasts and you can embody it 

Alexa 

success - finally having a workspace 

struggel - needing to decided if my partner stopps working or not

Wanting to recieve more with my womb, instead of doing it all on my own 

Nina - 

Success - managed to do a lot of work - very happy with the substrack - really nourishing for her, creates so much joy, is feeding her for other things 

struggle - accept that I cannot do as much as I used to 

Wants to finish the practicioner training - bufo training 

One in europe and the us every year 

go through having the bufo and the practicioner training at the same time 

people who work with medicine also have a different background, things coming together 

wants to work in the us - two big retreats, with sisters she has there 

having the gathering rolling in mallorca 

collaborating in mallorca 

grounding really into community and cocreation 

I am meditating a lot around community, tribe, working together, joining forces 

Someone that is creating things for others 

we are having a lot of similar feelings, but we still donâ€™t join forces  

there is still a blockages

What is it? what is the blockages? Understand what it is 

what do we need so we can come together 

Tribe/ Community/ Working together 

We all struggle with doing all the stuff our own? 

Why dont we join forces? 

What is it to wish to work together? 

What is the future of creating a business?

What is a family businesness? Can we go back there? How can we do that? 

That when tension comes up, we still stick together

Everyone is interdependent, but working towards a main goal

What is leadership? 

take responsibility - I want to be a good follower, or a good leader

Integrity of my vision, how can I lead, but other leaders can lead as well. 

Feels like we are meant to do something together - it keeps coming in ways, God is giving uns many chances to step in 

How was it meant to be? Or maybe whats the future? 

giving to others and also keeping my individuality - 

Know who we are, then we meet other individuals and can see where it can merge 

For example some people might not want to live on Mallorca so we cannot create something physical, but online 

Overview of the next four sessions 

how can we hold space for everyone 

its us to go to the idea, not pulling the idea to us.

Connecting to god, our wothiness

How can we can create a space where everybody has enough or what they need

Know your place from within - I am worthy 

Worthy of god, good is guiding me 

Knowing each other challenges, we could help each other with our expertise
