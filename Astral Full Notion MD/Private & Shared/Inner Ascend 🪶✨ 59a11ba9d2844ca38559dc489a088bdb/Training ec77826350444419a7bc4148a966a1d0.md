# Training

I want to update you on the training so that we can move forward together as a teamThis is how the training look like so far:

- a 6-month training dedicated to become a guide for yourself and for others
- the first 4 months will be the core-training dedicated to deep inner work: observing your story, traumas, patterns, beliefs
- the next 2 months will be only for the people that wish to become
therapists learning the skills and qualities that are required and
practicing regularly in pairs playing to be therapist & client
- -> a note on this: so far we said it's going to be 4 + 2 months but it
might also change where we are done with the whole conception if we
decide that it is best to cut it in different way; we'll also decline
the trainings in different offerings: there could be one masterclass
about the subject, a few week-end immersions, then some advanced
modules added to the core training... So that we can adapt that offering all kind of ppl wherever they are at the their journeyFor people participating to the core-training we could have 1 live per week for 4-months:
- 1st live per month: dedicated to explain the core teachings of the module + Q/A + give some homeplay/assignments to work on the different topics.
Some assignments are more like inquiry questions where participants have to reflect upon and some other assignments are more creative - for
example draw the timeline of your life with different events that marked you; or some art-therapy, self-portrait...
- 2nd live of the month: group coaching / sharing circle + 1 laser coaching
with a person that volunteers. Everyone has the opportunity to share
where they are at, receive some guidance, and one participant receive a
laser coaching in front of everyone. This is also a way to start to
teach "how to become a therapist" for those who will take the 2
additional months
- 3rd live of the month: community call: participants share in break-out
rooms (in dyad or tryad) with other participants about the assignments / homeplay they have been doing; this allows participants to bond deeper
and also learn to open up, be vulnerable and be in active listening;
then we are coming back in group setting to open any specific sharing
- 4th live of the month: a group practice connected to the module we're
contemplating; it could be a breathwork, family constellation,
meditation, quantum healing, any kind of embodiment / somatic / systemic practice, rituals, ceremonies, that could give new insights on more
subtle levels. This is also some kind of rite of passage to finish the
module / the topic and enter the next chapter

Here we'll have to decide who will be hosting those lives:

- I feel Nina, Jordi and I (and maybe Natasha?) and Ally and Natasha in
some sessions if you're going to add some specific parts to the
training.
- Then we could alternate the facilitators for the group coaching so that they can experience different types of holding space.
- I feel Ally and Natasha would be great for hosting the community calls.
We can also all pop up in break-out rooms to hear about everyone and
bond deeper.
- Then for the 4th live, the host will depend on which practice is offered. I
am happy to bring more of this and bring the kind of ceremonial / subtle energy part (maybe with Jordi as well?)

So far what have been done for the training:

- Jordi had written a lot of material about shadow work and many other interesting topics
- Nina have reworked a lot all the text, created the structure, the module and some assignments
- I wrote a glossary about important concepts in healing, a whole big part
on the skills and qualities of the therapists, intro of the training,
our values and some energy healing techniques
- All this will constitute a big training manual for our trainee

What's left to do:

- reading again everything and keeping only what's truly relevant, simplying, refining
- combining my parts in each module of what Nina & Jordi worked on
- Ideally in each module we wish to have: some "theoratical teaching", more
psychological aspects, but also some tips on somatic & energy work.
This is the strenght of our training: it's not just litteral about
traumas but takes in consideration all plans of consciousness and it is
made to understand but also embody and play with the energetics
- reading the inquiry & assignments and keeping only what's relevant
- adding more assignments that have to do with energy work & creative assignments
- recording some guided meditations & practices (audio)
- having a vision of what each live will be dedicated to (even if we don't want
to make it too rigid to allow some flow and presence in each live)
- Then of course once the whole content is done we'll have to market it on our website, socials and for this define the target etc...

Maybe [@Natasha](https://innerascend.slack.com/team/U06VC7J62FJ) you would be happy to support us with the structure and re-organizing and see what's relevant or missing?[@Ally](https://innerascend.slack.com/team/U06UPA9U867) in which way would you be happy to contribute for this training in areas where you are more expert?Maybe
 for those who actually wish to be therapist they could have a special 
added module or masterclass on how to start their business? Or maybe 
there is something else that calls you?We're
 also happy to receive feedbacks on anything mentioned above. This is 
what we have been feeling and thinking through with Nina but anything 
relevant is welcome for us to make it better.We're
 going to give you access to the training links soon so that you can 
have a better idea of what we worked on and start to help in the 
relecture and restructure. [@Nina](https://innerascend.slack.com/team/U06UPDU9BT4) [@Astral](https://innerascend.slack.com/team/U06UC1TU8SG) i know you wished that we go back to that Scripter software, if you have news about this would be awesome.T
