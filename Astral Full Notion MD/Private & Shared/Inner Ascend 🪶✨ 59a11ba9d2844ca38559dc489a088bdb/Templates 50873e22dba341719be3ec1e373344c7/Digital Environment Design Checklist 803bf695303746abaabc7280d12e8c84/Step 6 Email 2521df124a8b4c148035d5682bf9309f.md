# Email

## **Step 1: Unsubscribe and Organize**

The first thing we need to do is clean things up a bit

1. Scroll through your last 7 days of email
2. Unfollow any subscriptions you don‚Äôt feel are 100% necessary
3. For each post, ask yourself ‚ÄúIs this providing meaningful value to me and my goals?‚Äù
4. (Optional) Create folders and labels to better organize your inbox Consider using categories like "Work," "Personal," "Newsletters," etc.

(if your feed is extra messy, do it twice)

## **Step 2: Set up filters (optional)**

Once you have your folder and labels set up you use filters to automatically sort your incoming emails.
