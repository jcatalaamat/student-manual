## **Step 1: Clean up your feed**

Ok, this will be pretty much the same as Instagram.

1. Set a timer for 10 minutes
2. Scroll your Twitter feed
3. For each post, ask yourself “Is this providing meaningful value to me and my goals?”
4. If the answer is **“no”**, consider unfollowing or muting that creator

(if your feed is extra messy, do it twice)

## **Step 2: Create lists**

Lists are a great way to group creators based on what they provide to you.

1. Create a new list (Self-Development, Solopreneurship, Writing, etc.)
2. Add your favorite creators of that category to that list
3. Repeat for as many lists as you like
