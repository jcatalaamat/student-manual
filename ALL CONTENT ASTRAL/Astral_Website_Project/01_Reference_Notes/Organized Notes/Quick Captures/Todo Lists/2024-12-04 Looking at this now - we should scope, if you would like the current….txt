Looking at this now - we should scope, if you would like the current code or with some fixes to be finished by today and then tested again - when would you like to release the feature.I feel there were a few things out of scope? For example I didn't push back on showing a allergens dialog despite not having spoken about it, now adding the dietaries is more work, it can be done, but I find it a bit edgy for a MVP feature to go so intricate with all sorts of use cases and behaviours. Users can select a dish that says what allergens dietaries have, it's their responsibility. Specially since the main issue I assume it would be an allergen, which is covered. Dietaries... if someone is vegan and select a dish that doesn't say vegan it's their option no? And this also relies with venues actually setting all details on the course.I have so far added the meal selection to the RSVP page, tho I suppose that it makes sense to add it int he accommodation one, I either overlooked this or we didn't clearly add it
