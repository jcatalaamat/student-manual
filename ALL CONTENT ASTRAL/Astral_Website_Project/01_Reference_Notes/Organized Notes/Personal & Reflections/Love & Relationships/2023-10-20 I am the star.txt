I am the starI am the sonI am the daughterI am the brotherAnd the sisterI am youAnd youAnd I am no moreOr lessThan anyone elseI loveAnd I liveI die and I am rebornIn an endless cycleOf expansionAnd contractionI am the sound Of the wavesAnd the mountainsAnd the treesThe firesAnd the dropsThat cave inThe deepestIn the soilAs we plantThe seedsOf the luminous worldWe are to live in
