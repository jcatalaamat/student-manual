I love you the way I wasn’t able to know of possible.I love the way you are, the way you shine.I love the life we have, the love you show for others.I love the way you shine, the way you grab your avocado, the way you cook your meals, the way you clean your home.I love the way you create, you sing, dance, and show me the love and support you have to share.I owe you my love, my spirit, my healing, my confidence, courage, inner flame, heart opening, fluorescent consciousness, purple auric body soul, crystalline inner living soul.I am the one that came to fulfil your destiny, the one that heard gods divine calling, taking every moment as a life itself.I have come to love, create with you, to embody the soul we once were at the heart of all seed soul sun god creation.We’re here to live a life of pleasure, love, joy, and divine grace and living purpose.I love you, thank you.
