Otherwise, members may have difficulty converting tokens to cash.yes so how does that mean? investors and early users and maybe toher users are using money to get tokens to make this real, when or how can they begin to get profit in terms of selling their tokens for money or (i guess the other way is what i mentioned, maybe u pay for tokens but then that alllows u to be a facilitator whcih means u get paid for real when the dao earns fiat and you are paid as a worked))so whats up with cashing out tokens? is that needed? should the marketing be like well u kind of hold for a very very long time because the vision means in 10-15 years youre going to be millionare for having so much and so many global communities? i mean this is the spiritual welness alternative place, not sure how many users we’re going to make and how much money will be, the point is that because u are part of the family for holding enough tokens, you are supported and incentivised into being easy to reach people and have events to facilitate and retreats to cocreate which means eventually your life becomes this token and u can live forever with the fact u have this token? is that viable? but maybe many people will have this token will it still be valuable??No Fiat Conversion: Alternatively, you could restrict the ability to convert tokens into fiat entirely, making tokens usable only within the platform for governance, services, and rewards. Users would never be able to cash out into fiat, which keeps all value within the ecosystem.How would this work? I mean does this mean initial users will be rich easiliy? will they always be able to continue buying within the platform?the app could be this directory of services, support, practitioners, and eventually living and food within these community living places (otherwise people should only be able to make enough for their living food expenses or housing (unless they are in these communities) so if they are in these communities they get food also as exchange for tokens, and maybe only the community has to make money, which the DAO pays for their services, which serves to buy food etc and all the other thingswill long term users still pay within the app (the more the app grows, the more service, retreat spaces, hopefully retreat spaces, hostels, or whoever cooperates and begins accepting the token as an exchange (which means any service provider who is part of the dao, will have to accept at least part of payments (housing, living, food) as tokens and part as fiat, or how would the retreat space earn if all its members pay by tokens? will the community sell tokens for cash, or the DAO would do something in special for this local Node?3. Platform Launch: As more users join, they earn tokens for participation and staking. Token demand increases as users need tokens for governance and platform access. Token value rises to $0.50.  how would that be? token demand increases? does this mean a user comes to our app and buys our credits? does it mean when they buy our workshops or retreats they buy or not with fiat? get or not tokens in reward? or they have to buy tokens to then spend tokens? does that make any sense?we have more users joining, is that throuhg like a memberhsip? pay 50 euros a month and automatically get token payment to be able to use within the app, and as long as youre part of us, then u get other extra rewards besides otkens? like being in this sort of ‘memberhsip community organisation dao’??if i set the initial price at 0.01 or 0.1 how does it get to 0.5 before i list it? when the demand and buy and so one happens after i set initial sell, then its automatic calculateD? even before i go to exchangeS? or is it me who has changed its price because its a sort of (i guess i could do different launches, create prmotion and then be like this is second sale now its 0.2 per token, then 6 months later werve grown and we have new people waiting… etc etc)))i need to provide examples of how early users who pay 0.1 or 0.01 will eventually be able to cash 500 tokens but ofc 500 tokens at the first month is not the same as the 5th year, and so they realise they dont have to sell so much to get a lot of profits outwhen users stake tokens, will it automatically make the token price grow? even if we’re not listed in exchanges? or not?Long-Term Holding Incentive: Users are encouraged to hold tokens because they offer exclusive platform benefits (like discounts, voting power, or staking rewards). They hold tokens instead of cashing out immediately.what kind of discounts? for inner-ascend.comFacilitators Need to Stake: Facilitators may need to stake a minimum number of tokens to offer services within the DAO. This way, holding tokens becomes a requirement for becoming a facilitator, which further incentivizes users to hold tokens rather than sell them.pyramid, mroe tokens staked, higher crazy moment of retreat or something, like higher purpose retreat, or better locations, etc, depending on how much staking u can facilitate in different places, maybe the event location will earn mroe or less depending on the facilitaor who stakes there? thats an economy of staking to participate, then divide earnings that rhe local community makes, what if at some point everyone who attends a retreat is part of the dao? only tokens are being exchanged? will that still work within the DAO? will the dao director reward the local community with tokens or money for that so they can still buy food and so on?Governance and Influence: Holding more tokens could give users more voting power in the DAO’s governance system. This allows them to influence decisions, such as which events or retreats get funded, new platform features, or major changes to the DAO structure.the higher your tokens, the more you can allow yourself to go to different hotel community or whatever place that costs more of your tokens to be part of it (how do you manage to get a network of locations or retreat spaces or living communities that is happy to receive members and still makes fiat?)high end retreats for humans	•	Entry-Level Facilitators: Stake a minimum number of tokens to offer basic services (e.g., standard retreats or coaching sessions).	•	Example: A facilitator stakes 100 tokens to offer a retreat in a smaller or less popular location.	•	Mid-Level Facilitators: Stake more tokens to unlock access to better locations or higher-value events.	•	Example: A facilitator stakes 500 tokens and gains access to host a well-known retreat center, or facilitates a larger, more prestigious retreat.	•	High-Level Facilitators: The highest tier of facilitators stake significant amounts of tokens to gain access to elite locations or higher purpose retreats.	•	Example: A facilitator stakes 1,000 tokens to host retreats at premium locations or co-create retreats with renowned speakers or practitioners.how would this work? like i could have in the app (to facilitate here, stake 500, book dates, etc) how does a venue benefit from you hosting there? and how you get revenue from it?ideally all payments go to global DAO account and then its paid to its subsidiaries (local nodes) otherwise how is the DAO making profit (to reinvest) when paid directly to local nodes? it has to be form the OU to the DAO to the local nodes, so its each location who gets paid by its ‘parent DAO’)as a facilitator, u also get special events or residencies that are ONLY for facilitators, rather than be merged with other normal humans—To kickstart the project, funds are raised through:	•	Token Sales: Early supporters and investors buy tokens that will give them access to future services, governance rights, and possibly land ownership in the village.	•	Crowdfunding: A campaign could be launched on platforms like IndieGoGo or Kickstarter to attract funds for building the first village.	•	Private Investors: Engage socially conscious investors who are interested in funding sustainable living projects and community-building efforts.——Reputation Tokens: Users earn reputation tokens for their contributions to the community, such as offering services, participating in governance, or helping with infrastructure. These tokens don’t have monetary value but offer privileges (e.g., better housing, priority access to events).Rewarding Participation: Facilitators or workers who consistently contribute positively get boosted reputations, which gives them access to better jobs, event hosting, or leadership roles in the village.Fractional Land Ownership: Use tokens to represent fractional ownership of the land or buildings within the village. Early investors or residents buy into the community and own stakes in the property through smart contracts.——-Unified App for All Interactions: Create one app where users can buy tokens, book retreats, pay for services, and vote on governance without ever leaving the platform. Everything happens in one place. No external platforms or apps.To the point: The app should feel as simple as Apple Pay — tap, confirm, and done. You buy tokens, book retreats, and interact with the community in 3 clicks or less.DAO-Managed Fiat for External Services: For global governance, ensure that the DAO uses fiat profits (from external users who pay for retreats or workshops) to fund new projects, develop infrastructure, and expand the global community.——I can keep using the OU and have normal contracts (what Ally was doing) to have some ‘legal’ payment to keep payng them monthly by contract workpayment or trading barter exchangeno credits either u pay the price or u request exchangerequest exchange or pay 80 euro—————ok so we want to make it a DAOcommunity living, management, promotion events, retreats, experiences, but also a global community where people use the tokens to spend in accomodation, living, exchanging with others in other places.would 1 dao cover every community? the idea of using one coin for all?——include ecovillages, farms, retreat centers, indivudals, professionals, etc
