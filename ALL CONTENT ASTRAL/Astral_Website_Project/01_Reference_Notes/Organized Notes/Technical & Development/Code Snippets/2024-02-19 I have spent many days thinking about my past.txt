I have spent many days thinking about my past There was a time when you and I had a connection. Then there was God, and then the connection was gone.Who am I to will the opposite to God?I’m honest, you had gone. You’ve left me to my pain and sorrow.You didn’t hold me. Nor you. Nor you.When God came, you left me astray, let me to my death, deep long death.I am long time dead, gone to the oblivious abyss.Where were you, my long time friends? Where did you go, my long time brother?I was alone for the most important period. I was lonely with no connections to show me the way, to walk with me, to hold me on my feet.I can’t show up for you now. I can’t go above and beyond the biggest cliffs to pull you out of the muddy waters.I’ve taken off, onto another world, and I’m not the one who’s supposed to pull you up. You’ve made your choice.I love you, thank you.
