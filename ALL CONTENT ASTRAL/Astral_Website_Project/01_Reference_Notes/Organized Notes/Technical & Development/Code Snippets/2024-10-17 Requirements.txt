• Requirements• HOST Menu selection - allow the Host to select individual items from a menu rather than the entire menu (as on the venue side). Add the check boxes as per individual items.• • Business logic at VENUE level / Food &amp Drink to limit the number of items per category that a HOST can select e.g. 3 x canapé, 1 x starter. NB this would be for the HOST only not the venue.• Friendly alert to say something like: [Hold up! You can only select [x] items in this category. Please message your venue if you would like to add more - [send message]. Could also add logic to Menu level - so they can only choose one menu unless they request to their EM/ venue to add more?• Add date ranges to menus so host only sees those available for their event• NB ability for venue to see all / select other menus on their side
