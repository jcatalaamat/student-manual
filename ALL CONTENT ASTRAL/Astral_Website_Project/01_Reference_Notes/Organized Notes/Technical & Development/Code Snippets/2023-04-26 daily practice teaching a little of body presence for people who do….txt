daily practice teaching a little of body presence for people who do not move the body and do not need to do it insanely. Teach meditation breathing and a little of visualisation of bottom of feet and inviting energy to clear the space and their life on different aspects. Make a theme for each session, everyday has a word as intention; could be foot, or leg, or an empotion, feeling, or gene key, ancestor, etc, and from there there is a little 10min channel at the beginning of the session right after opening up the space and while exploring the movements of the body. then you get into deeper practice and stronger movement and more arms and shaking and moving and exploring sound and release, a little osho meditation style, to allow them to have a let go that no one else lets them outside of the class.
