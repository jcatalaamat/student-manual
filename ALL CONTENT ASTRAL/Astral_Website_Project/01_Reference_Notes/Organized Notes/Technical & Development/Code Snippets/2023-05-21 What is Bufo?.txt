What is Bufo?Bufo is the single most important experience you may have in your life beyond your birth, death, birth of a child, and most important breakups in some relationships in your life.Bufo reminds us of the relevance of each and every moment of NOW.Life is happening in an eternal dance of flow in expansion / contraction and you are able to tap in and out of the aspects that more ressonate with the current vibration where you are.You are the mothership. It is all happening within and without you. It is all here. Inside your you-niversal heart.You are the space in between NOWs.Bring your awareness to the moment of NOW reminding yourself that NOW never ended and is ever here, in every moment and feeling of your life, it is still happening NOW.Bufo makes the innaparent apparent, showing you where youâ€™ve been hiding from your own past, still NOW, and showing you how your choices have defined the story of your you-niverse.Astral Integration is a framework and modality to clear the dissonance that magnifies and magneticfies the attraction of the poles that lead you to get attached to certain frequencies that are not on your best and highest interest.Life goes around in cycles of death and rebirth and we often find the doors of the past and allows us to jump and recreate or free ourselves from previous stage patterns that played when we were developing ourselves as our own universe.Astral Integration says that we stay frozen ib many different moments, on our astral body, for both expansion or contraction, or over or understimulation. When we froze to death or exploded in fire we both overburtn our circuits and became dissasociated from what was happening and attached ourselves to a different life form to prevent what we thought death was going to be.If you're interested in this let me know as I'm working on developing it further to be shared.Aho ase namaste.
