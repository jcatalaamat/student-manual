Hi everyone, it was great meeting you the other night and connecting with such an inspiring group. I facilitate sacred medicine circles with El Sapo (Bufo) for those seeking deep healing and spiritual transformation. These ceremonies provide a space for profound clarity, self-discovery, and connection to your higher purpose. I’m also working on a crypto-based collective land ownership project that merges decentralization, sustainability, and community. If you’re interested in collaborating or exchanging ideas, let’s connect!
