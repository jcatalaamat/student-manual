My parents woke up to a stolen worldThey realised it when it was too lateThey were full in the trip and when they realised what was happening they were out completely spit on the spaceLike arriving in a big flap on the groundThen they realised they were aliveThen it was all too lateIt was all too lateMy mum realised it was too lateBy the time she wanted to live she was too lateShe sucked it upShe died insideAnd poisoned usMy mum thing was already too lateIt was too late for her to experience life as she wantedPeople are AIWeâ€™ve outsmarted ourselves and allowed to tap out from life as a way not to experience suffering
