# React/Next.js Content Structure Guide
## AI-Friendly, Easy to Maintain, Scalable

## Philosophy

**Keep content separate from code**
- All text, images, and data in dedicated content files
- AI can edit content without touching React components
- Non-developers can update content easily
- Single source of truth for all website copy

**Use simple, readable formats**
- JSON for structured data
- Markdown for long-form content
- TypeScript for type safety
- Clear naming conventions

### 6. TypeScript Types (`src/lib/types.ts`)

```typescript
/**
 * TYPESCRIPT TYPES
 *
 * Shared types used across the application.
 * Ensures type safety for all content.
 */

// CTA (Call-to-Action)
export interface CTA {
  label: string;
  href: string;
  style?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline';
  openInNewTab?: boolean;
}

// Image
export interface Image {
  src: string;
  alt: string;
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
}

// Price
export interface Price {
  amount: number;
  currency: 'EUR' | 'USD' | 'GBP';
  period?: 'session' | 'month' | 'year' | 'package' | 'donation';
}

// Service (Generic)
export interface Service {
  id: string;
  slug: string;
  name: string;
  tagline?: string;
  description: string;
  longDescription?: string;
  image: string | Image;
  price: Price;
  cta: CTA;
  featured?: boolean;
  category: 'circle' | 'session' | 'medicine' | 'training';
}

// Contact Form Submission
export interface ContactFormData {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phone?: string;
  serviceInterest: string[];
  message: string;
  subscribe?: boolean;
}

// Blog Post (Metadata)
export interface BlogPost {
  slug: string;
  title: string;
  excerpt: string;
  date: string;
  author: string;
  category: string[];
  tags: string[];
  featuredImage: string;
  readTime: number; // in minutes
  published: boolean;
}
```

## How to Use This Structure

### For You (Non-Developer):
1. **To update text:** Edit the `.ts` files in `src/content/`
2. **To add a new service:** Add object to appropriate array (circles, sessions, etc.)
3. **To change prices:** Update the `price` object in any service
4. **To add testimonials:** Add to `testimonials.ts`
5. **To update contact info:** Edit `site.ts`

### For Claude (AI):
1. **Clear file structure:** AI knows exactly where to find/edit content
2. **Typed data:** TypeScript ensures AI doesn't create invalid structures
3. **Comments:** Every file has clear purpose documentation
4. **Helper functions:** Pre-built functions for common queries
5. **Consistent patterns:** Same structure repeated across all content types

### For Developers:
1. **Separation of concerns:** Content is completely separate from components
2. **Type safety:** Full TypeScript support prevents errors
3. **Easy to test:** Content can be tested independently
4. **CMS-ready:** This structure can easily migrate to Sanity/Contentful later
5. **Performance:** Static content = fast builds and runtime

## Example Component Usage

### Using content in a React component:

```typescript
// src/app/page.tsx (Homepage)
import { homeContent } from '@/content/pages/home'
import { circles } from '@/content/offerings/circles'
import { getFeaturedTestimonials } from '@/content/testimonials'

export default function HomePage() {
  const featured = circles.filter(c => c.featured)
  const testimonials = getFeaturedTestimonials()

  return (
    <>
      {/* Hero Section */}
      <section className="hero">
        <h1>{homeContent.hero.heading}</h1>
        <p>{homeContent.hero.subheading}</p>
        <Button href={homeContent.hero.cta.href}>
          {homeContent.hero.cta.label}
        </Button>
      </section>

      {/* Introduction */}
      <section className="introduction">
        <h2>{homeContent.introduction.heading}</h2>
        <p>{homeContent.introduction.body}</p>
      </section>

      {/* Featured Circles */}
      <section className="circles">
        <h2>Featured Circles</h2>
        <div className="grid">
          {featured.map(circle => (
            <CircleCard key={circle.id} circle={circle} />
          ))}
        </div>
      </section>

      {/* Testimonials */}
      <section className="testimonials">
        <TestimonialCarousel testimonials={testimonials} />
      </section>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### âœ… For Content Management:
- **All content in one place** - `src/content/` directory
- **No need to touch components** to update text
- **Easy for AI to parse** and modify
- **Version control friendly** - clear diffs when content changes
- **Can be edited by non-developers**

### âœ… For Development:
- **Type-safe** - TypeScript catches errors
- **DRY** - Reusable content structures
- **Scalable** - Easy to add new services/pages
- **Testable** - Content can be unit tested
- **Migrable** - Easy to move to CMS later

### âœ… For AI (Claude):
- **Clear file purposes** - Each file has one job
- **Documented structure** - Comments explain everything
- **Predictable patterns** - Same structure everywhere
- **Easy to search** - Find content by file name
- **Safe to edit** - Won't break components

## Adding New Content Examples

### Add a new circle:
```typescript
// In src/content/offerings/circles.ts
// Just add to the array:

{
  id: "new-circle-id",
  slug: "new-circle-slug",
  name: "New Circle Name",
  tagline: "Catchy tagline",
  description: "Short description...",
  // ... rest of properties
}
```

### Add a new page:
```typescript
// Create src/content/pages/new-page.ts

export const newPageContent = {
  hero: {
    heading: "Page Heading",
    subheading: "Subheading text"
  },
  sections: [
    {
      title: "Section 1",
      body: "Content..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Update site-wide info:
```typescript
// In src/content/site.ts
export const siteConfig = {
  contact: {
    email: "new-email@domain.com", // Just change here!
    // Updates everywhere automatically
  }
}
```

---

## Maintenance Workflow

### Weekly:
1. Add new testimonials to `testimonials.ts`
2. Update pricing in service files if changed
3. Add blog posts to `content/blog/posts/`

### Monthly:
1. Review all pricing
2. Update featured items
3. Add new services if needed
4. Archive old testimonials

### As Needed:
1. Update about page story
2. Add new service categories
3. Update contact info
3. Change CTAs for campaigns

## Migration to CMS (Future)

When ready to move to a CMS like Sanity:

1. **Keep the same structure** - Export from `.ts` to CMS
2. **Use same types** - TypeScript types become CMS schemas
3. **Minimal code changes** - Just change imports from local to CMS
4. **Gradual migration** - Move one content type at a time

Example:
```typescript
// Before (local content):
import { circles } from '@/content/offerings/circles'

// After (CMS):
import { circles } from '@/lib/sanity/queries'
// Components stay the same!
```

## Questions for You

Would you like me to:

1. **Create a starter template** with all this set up?
2. **Add more example content files** (sessions, medicine work, etc.)?
3. **Build actual React components** that use this content?
4. **Create a simple CMS admin panel** for editing (no code)?
5. **Show you how to deploy** this on Vercel/Netlify?

This structure is designed to be **AI-friendly** and **easy to maintain** even if you're not a developer. Everything is readable, organized, and well-documented!
