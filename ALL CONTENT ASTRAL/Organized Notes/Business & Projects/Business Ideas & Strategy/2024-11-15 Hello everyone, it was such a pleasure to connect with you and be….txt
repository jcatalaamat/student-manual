Hello everyone, it was such a pleasure to connect with you and be part of an inspiring group of individuals. The conversations and energy shared left me feeling deeply appreciative to have met you and motivated to explore new opportunities and ideas.A bit about me: I work as a multifaceted guide, helping entrepreneurs, leaders, visionaries, and changemakers align their personal and professional lives with their truest purpose and mission. My approach blends spirituality, intuitive insights, and ancestral healing to create a unique path for growth. I assist people in scaling both their businesses and personal lives by helping them align their heart, soul, and goals. This ensures they move forward authentically, staying true to themselves rather than following external pressures or distractions.I also facilitate sacred medicine circles with El Sapo (Bufo) for those seeking profound healing and spiritual connection. These transformative ceremonies offer a space for clarity, self-discovery, and deep inner work.On another note, I’m also an engineer passionate about creating meaningful projects. Currently, I’m working on a crypto-based initiative focused on collective land ownership that combines decentralization, technology, and community to build sustainable opportunities. I’m actively seeking collaborators—whether you’re interested in investment, technical input, or brainstorming together. If this resonates, let’s connect and explore possibilities!
