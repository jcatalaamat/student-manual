Hey everyone, it was great connecting with you and being part of such an amazing and inspiring group of people. The stories and energy shared left me feeling deeply grateful to know you and motivated to explore new possibilities.A little about me: I’m a multifaceted medicine man who helps individuals—especially entrepreneurs, business leaders, visionaries, and change-makers—align their lives and ventures with their deepest purpose and true mission. My approach merges life and business by tapping into spirituality, intuitive channeling, and ancestral healing. I guide people to scale their lives and businesses by integrating their heart, soul, and goals, ensuring they grow from a place of authenticity rather than chasing external pressures or distractions.I also offer sacred medicine circles with El Sapo (Bufo) for those seeking deep healing and spiritual awakening. These ceremonies create space for profound transformation, clarity, and connection with your highest self.On the other side of my multifaceted work, I’m an engineer with a passion for building impactful projects. I’m currently working on a crypto-based idea for collective land ownership, combining technology, decentralization, and community to create sustainable and shared opportunities. I’m looking for collaborators—whether that’s investment, tech support, or even just someone to bounce ideas off of. If this sparks your interest, let’s talk!
