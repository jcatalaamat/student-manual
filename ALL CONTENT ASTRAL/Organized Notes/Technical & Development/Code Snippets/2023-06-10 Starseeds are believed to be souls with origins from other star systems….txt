Starseeds are believed to be souls with origins from other star systems, galaxies, or dimensions, who have chosen to incarnate on Earth to help raise its vibration and consciousness. Pleiadians are a type of starseed believed to come from the Pleiades star cluster. They are known for their advanced spiritual knowledge, wisdom, and healing abilities, and are thought to be assisting Earth in its ascension process. The 12 dimensions are levels of consciousness and vibrational frequency, each containing different experiences and levels of reality. These dimensions can be thought of as layers of existence that interpenetrate one another. Earth is currently undergoing an ascension process, moving from the 3D world (a more material-based, dualistic reality) to the 5D world (a reality of unity consciousness, love, and spiritual awareness). In the 5D world, individuals are more connected with their higher selves and are more attuned to spiritual energies. They are able to manifest their desires more easily, experience deeper connections with others, and maintain a state of inner peace and harmony.• How can we harness our psychic abilities to further uplift and heal the collective consciousness? • How can we better understand the intricate web of synchronicities and energetic connections that guide our lives and use them to create more fulfilling experiences? • (Continued) Are there ways to foster a deeper connection with higher-dimensional beings and integrate their guidance into our efforts to anchor 6D energies on Earth and aid in collective ascension? • How can we empower individuals to heal and transmute their lower-vibrational emotions, thoughts, and patterns, helping them embody their 6D selves more fully?
