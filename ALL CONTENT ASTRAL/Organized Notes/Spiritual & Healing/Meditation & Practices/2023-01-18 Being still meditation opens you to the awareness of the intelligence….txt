Eg lévitation won’t work as you probably don’t need it in this world Breathing grounds the love Still meditation ungrounds youExtremes are great to experience different states of consciousness. Fears may arise as it’s time to change state to another extreme. Fear of not balancing and loosing your progress or falling back to sleepYou have to breath to feel the heart of the other and become one heartEverything you put into you alters your state: food, water, music, incense, sounds, peoples voices, peoples energies. It’s good to manipulate your state and it’s not great to not sensory deprivate yourself from these to find your own voice and truth
