Hi everyone, how are you? It was wonderful connecting with you the other night and being part of such an inspiring group.I wanted to let you know that I facilitate sacred medicine circles with El Sapo (Bufo), a powerful tool for deep healing, clarity, and transformation. Often called the sacred medicine for CEOs, Bufo’s effects are short yet profoundly impactful.I offer microdose circles for those interested in exploring its benefits gently, as well as private ceremonies in the comfort of your home or a safe space. My wife and I have been facilitating these transformative experiences for over four years.If this speaks to you, feel free to reach out—I’d be happy to share more.
