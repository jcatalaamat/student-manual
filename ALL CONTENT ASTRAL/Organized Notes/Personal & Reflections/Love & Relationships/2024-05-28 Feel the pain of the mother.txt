Feel the pain of the mother The sacrifice of the lost onesThe lost voices of the unknownHear the tears of the someThe cry of the lonely ones After the death has carriedFeel the healing of the young Express the right path and release the left pathJust post yourself being sillyOR begin by being funny and then take pics of yourself or record yourself I feel shame to love my mother and my parents in front of my partnerAs if I had to have sex with my mum to love themThat's how I fear
