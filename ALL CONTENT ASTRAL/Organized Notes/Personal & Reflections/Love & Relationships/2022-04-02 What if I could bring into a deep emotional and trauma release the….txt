What if I could bring into a deep emotional and trauma release the person by just loving? Loving meaning trusting in myself so much and feeling the energy thst I could trust my body in moving into ayahuasca movements while feeling OK by receiving the light of God thst way without shame and without fear of being wronged? Being so in love that the kundalini rises thru me and moves my body as I transcend the trauma of the person through myself. As if was making love to their energy body while they release whilst the case is that's how creative energy feels through me as it expresses itself and transforms the person light body. It's shifting the perspective from being sexual to being creative and allow that creativity to flow thru me in movements without shutting it down or fearing is wrong. It's ecstasi and it does not have anything to do with sex. I have to allow this energy to overflow through me without fear of being sexual or thoughts that some movements or sounds may be self judged as sexual. How to switch from making love to being creative? The energy is love not make love. And love is creation. That's the energy to tune into love. Love making can be kundalini moving thru me and expressing through movement, prays, symbols and sound. That's making love to God or to commute with God or being in ecstasi and it's to connect with the power of creation. Making love to God is not sex. Making love does not require physical bodies it requires communion with the energy of love, God, and the kundalini. Movement freedom. It's the seed of creation.Cosmic channel
