What am i trying to dowhats not workingwhat have I done so farGuest has no invitation but has an assigned roomI am trying to redirect the Guest into the RSVP LIST Page so they can input their dietaries if they haven’t alreadyWhat is not working is that when I redirect them to the RSVP page current logic only takes into account (for dietaries) that the guest actually is attendingI was adding a little bit of code to make sure I could make the choice to require dietaries by either seeing this guest is attending and has no dietaries or this guest is not attending (as there’s no invitation) but he is booked in a room, therefor if he doesn’t have dietaries, it means he has to input themIssue is that when I am in that page and I am able to show in the portal correctly that this guest actually has to add dietaries, when I click save, updates the guest, fetches the rsvps, but somehow the hooks usePermission which is used to show/hide the tab blocks on accommodation, doesn’t update.
