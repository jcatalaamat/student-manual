## 1st page

**Turn-ons:**

- i love the video for the “we are a collective…”
- AI chat, really cool!
- The images that move at the same time that we go down
- Love the “membership exclusive” title

**Edits suggestions:**

- 1st banner: “training, membership, coaching” could be clickable to send directly to the corresponding pages
- 3rd banner “become part of a vibrant”: Too much space between the text and “explore”
I know it’s something we have discussed and was given you as feedback but on my opinion, we shouldn’t put the price yet here. We have not yet explain who we are, what we offer, they don’t know so much about us yet and the price is a turn-off for me here. Especially because although that we said it’s an attractive price, looking at the competitors the memberships are most of all around 15€ or so. Of course not offering the quality of what we offer and mainly recorded stuff while we offer lives. But this is why i would first explain the richness of our offering before announcing a price that might be a turn-off.
- Change the description of Integration circle
- “customized coaching” banner: maybe add “1-1 coaching” to understand directly it’s something else than the membership; 
Too much space between the text and “explore”
- The team: would be nice if that’s technically possible to appear the 5 of us on the main page
- Too much space between “be part of our community” and “learn more”

& le button “learn more” is not linked to any page

- Nice touch on the “donate” button: could have a little sentence “support us develop new projects for our community” or any other sentence
- Under the training banner: the button “explore” has link to the training page (right now it links to the 1st page)

## Membership page

**Edits suggestions**

- For me the price would come at the very end: it is when i know all the offerings, the detail of what i’m going to receive that i finally feel excited to give my money each month. And it would be great because there is already a sign up button at the very beggining in the first banner so i can sign up rather up or down to the page and it doesn’t make sense for me to read the whole page and have to come up again to have to sign up.
- “What does the membership include” —> access to the replayS (misses an S)
- Cancellation membership: adding a little sentence on how they can cancel their membership: is there a special button? do they need to send us an email? how long in advance before the billing period?
- in “circles and ceremonies”: it seems that we need delate 1 space between “celebrate” and “interconectedness” (not sure about that one)
- in “activations and meditations”: it seems that we need delate 1 space between “participants” and “awaken” (not sure about that one)

## Each individual event page

**Edits suggestions:**

- adding the photo of the event again here
- adding a few words on the facilitator & link to their page (+ photo?)

## 1-1 Programs

**Turn-on**: one of my favourite concepts of Inner Ascend; from the researchs with other competitors i feel this concept is really what distinguishes us the most from other offerings; i feel this is something we can advertise more on our socials. 
I also love so much the topics you choose!

**Edits suggestions:** 

- adding the practitioners they will be working with and a link to their page
- i would like to understand a bit more the concept and its uniqueness through the description: explaining that it’s quite unique to work on a topic in 1-1 and receiving the guidance of several specialists that have different approaches and vision and background
- relationship bundle; “what to expect”: it seems that we need delate 1 space between “through” and “insightful” (not sure about that one)
- The bundle could also include a chat-based coaching in between the sessions and some suggested practices, meditations and routines to implement in their daily life
- “spiritual transition bundle”: “aN empowering” —> misses the “n”
- in the “emotional healing” bundle: 
in the “what to excpect: “learn how to heal your past” —> misses a space between “how” and “your” + misses a “R” to “Your”;

      in the “who is it for” —> past traumaS —> addig “s” to “trauma”

Add a point after “challenge” instead of a coma

- “inner child” bundle:  
in the “what to excpect: “learn how to heal your past” —> misses a space between “how” and “your” + misses a “R” to “Your”;

      in the “who is it for” —> past traumaS —> adding “s” to “trauma”

Add a point after “challenge” instead of a coma

- “career alignment” and “artistic inspiration”: is there a way to delate the excess of space bellow the text of “what to expect”?
- the reviews: the pace goes a bit too fast for me

## Practitioner individual page

**Turn-on**: really cool! all the presentation, the Q/A, the option to book 1:1…

## Training page

- details & typos:

“The Inner Ascend Training’s  is  a” —> too much space between ‘s and is? and between is and a? 

“authentic ,aware,” —> “authentic, aware” (coma + space)

## General feedback

Esthetic, modern, rich, deep, exciting, field of vast possibilities
