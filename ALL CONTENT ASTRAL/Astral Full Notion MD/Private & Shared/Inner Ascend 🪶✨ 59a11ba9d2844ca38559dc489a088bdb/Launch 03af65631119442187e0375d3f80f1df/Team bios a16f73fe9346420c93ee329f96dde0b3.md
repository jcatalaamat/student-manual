1. *Introduction:*

I’m Natasha, also known as La Catalyste. Life adventurer, my favourite landscapes to explore are those of the human psyche. I’m a trauma informed holistic therapist and coach who specialises in Love and emotional healing.

Here, I am referred to as the shapeshifter of Inner Ascend. I’m the one who welcomes you in the Inner Ascend space and makes sure you get the best experience. I get to know you and I put you in touch with the practitioners that are the best fit for you, based on your intentions and your needs. I also take care of the community, through Discord, Instagram and e-mails, and I hold live healing circles once a week. 

Making Exploration and Understanding the core of my life, it is important for me to contribute and share all the tools and knowledge I gathered throughout the years. On top of the healing circles, I offer 1:1 ponctual appointment, as well as a program about Love, and a Life Tutorial holding all the basics we should have learned at school.

Bringing light to the shadows and unifying sky and earth, I support you in living a meaningful life, bringing peace and bliss to your daily life, and getting you aligned with your higher self.

1. Origin Story 

Starting my healing journey when I was 19, as I wanted to die but couldn’t see why, it is in therapy that I opened my eyes on 2 major traumas that happened in my life: childhood incest and sexual assault. 9 years later, I now know these traumas were only the consequences of the complex trauma that was my childhood and my education. Growing up emotionally enmeshed with every member of my family, who did their best to survive on their own traumas, abuse and emotional neglect, my lack of boundaries and my constant living in survival mode got me retraumatised many times throughout the years. 

It is through an intense co-dependent relationship in 2019 that my reality fliped upside down and I internally exploded in a billion of pieces. After 6 months of denial and survival, I consciously made the decision to choose me and to start loving myself. This choice was catalysed by a psychedelic mushroom trip in 2020 through which I connected with my true self, and decided to radically change my life. I quit my job as a 3D animator and enrolled in a psychedelic coaching course. Last but not least, a few months later, it’s during a subconscious healing session that I had my biggest breakthrough, my first mystical experience : after a relieving inner child healing episode, I could allow myself to feel what it is to have Faith. I felt what it is to trust the Universe.

Since then, through my empathetic and intuitive nature as well as my deep understanding of existence itself, I act as a catalyst for others to heal, step into their truth, unlock the love that’s within and develop a sense of trust in what is beyond our understanding. 

1. *Philosophy and Approach:*
- How do you define your teaching or healing philosophy?

Personal support

With an emphasis on Love and Self-Love, I offer 1:1 appointments and groupcalls where I guide you to connect to your inner power and reach your fullest potential, by helping you heal from your past and guiding you through your self-actualisation. I help you transmute your pain into power thanks to my holistic therapeutical approach, combining my understanding of emotions and human psyche with my practical coaching skills. My trauma informed practice involves nervous system regulation, shadow integration work, as well as symbolic and energetical practices. 

Relationship healing program

5 years after the break-up that cracked me open, I am now guiding you from recovering from a break-up and sexual/emotional abuse, to falling in love consciously and peacefully, by initiating you to the arts of Love and Self-Love. I guide you through connecting back to yourself, making sense of your story and your love story, and learning more about a healthy way of relating. Through shared insights and understandings, guided nervous system regulation and emotional release, and healing practices, you will be all set up to navigate life and love the best way. 

Life Tutorial 101

- What’s a belief or value that deeply influences your work?

I deeply believe that everything in our Being is interconnected, therefore my approach is holistic and includes conversational therapy, visualisation exercices and emotional regulation practices. I work as much with the present issues and sensations in your body, as with energies and subconscious realms.

## @Alina Rösken

*Introduction:*

- I am Ally,  a spiritual being, experienced business creator, envisionor and consultant that helps change-makers to craft their own business of impact and follow their vision of a thriving living. As a woman with profound knowledge in various areas such as vision work, manifestation, authentic relating and yoga, you find me hosting transformational experiences, ceremonies and 1:1 spaces of business creation. Through thought-provoking and action-empowering offerings, I serve as a bridge between the worlds of aligned action and playful exploration.
- 
- enable you to step into your full potential, ushering in a generation dedicated to making a lasting impact on this planet.
1. *Origin Story:*
    - In the quest of finding my self after emerging from a very dark period of my life I left my home village at 21 , travelling around the world. Soon I began the practice of yoga, which soon lead to an awakening that came rather unexpected. The awareness and apprecitation for life grew, and my era of teaching began. At the start I found myself at a crossroad between spirituality and corporate, between hour long meditations and management timelines. The thing was, I adored both worlds. As a woman on the path of entrepreneurship and business elevation I always thought that I had to keep these two lives separate. ‘No way they could ever mix’, I thought my deal was to hide one from the other. What I thought to be limiting on my own journey of awakening, actually turned out to be the base I could build on. My career and the recent travels had equipped me with the tools to not only guide people towards creating a thriving reality for themselves, but also to turn their gaze inwards and find..peace. So here I am merging two worlds, impactful business and grounded spirituality.
2. *Philosophy and Approach:*
    - My vision is to provide a pathway to freedom, a liberating invitation to embrace your authentic self and craft your life in perfect harmony with it. I am dedicated to empowering individuals to embark on a journey of heightened creativity, an odyssey that ignites their passion and compels them to lead lives driven by purpose and positive impact. I firmly believe that our world thrives when we express our true potential. As such, my workshops and 1:1 spaces serve as guiding lights, igniting innovative business ideas, nurturing profound creations, and nurturing lives filled with deep fulfillment. Through thought-provoking and action-empowering offerings, my mission is to enable you to step into your full potential, ushering in a generation dedicated to making a lasting impact on this planet.
3. *A Day in the Life:*
    - As a woman that chooses the freedom of location in life , the places I wake up in tend to look very different throughout the months. Yet, a set routine helps me to remain grounded whereever i am. Hot lemon water, yoga and breath, cacao or late breakfast. I pour my head and heart daily into my projects, spend my days working on my clients businesses, hosting workshops or crafting new spaces for you to meet yourself in. What I couldnt do without? My daily stroll through nature, feet on the earth, playing with the trees, singing.
4. *Fun and Quirky Insights:*
    - What’s something surprising or unexpected about you?
    
    From the outside, one could perceive me as innocent or mild. Something that always comes a little unexpected is that I actually LOVE to play and challenge the given. I am not afraid to show myself - even if that triggers one or the other at times. My kink is inviting you to be yourself and reaching out a hand for you to do the same. Fun fact: This is related to my own healing journey, so find out what happens if you reach out a hand for me ;) 
    
    - If you could have any superpower, what would it be and why?
    - I think we all have that superpower within us already. It is about unlocking our true power and setting it free to create what benefits the greater good.
5. *Wisdom for the Journey:*
    
    A piece of advice I would give anyone on their path to enlightenment would be to meet yourself with compassion, whereever you find yourself. Hold yourself tight through the tears & fears that come with learning. Care for your wounds and ask for support. Love the shit out of your past selves, as each version tried their very best and brought you to that miracle of a place you find yourself in today. 
    
6. *Looking Ahead:*
    - What excites you most about the future of Inner Ascend?
    - Most of our fellow humans have been looking for community. The one where being your true nature is inevitable and asked for. Where we meet each other, spend time earthing around, cooking together, moving - getting to know what it means to grow as one. Inner Ascend is that, but you take it with you. You see, IA is a place that goes everywhere you go. Everywhere you go, your familia follows. And thats what I am excited about.
    - How do you envision your role evolving as the community grows?
    - Right now I spend most days creating an outline for IA, a structure that our community can thrive on. In the future I envision planning onsite retreats and gatherings, playing with you and expanding our vision of home.

## @Karlyn Sovied

### 1. Introduction

I am Karlyn, trauma-informed therapist, shamanic facilitator, psychedelic integration coach and trainer for holistic practitioners. 
Inspired by the dream of a harmonious world, my passion lies in the intersection of individual transformation and collective change. I believe that as we each journey towards healing and wholeness, we organically contribute to the broader shift towards peace, unity, and harmony, on our planet Earth. As a guide, I strive to empower lightful beings in their florescence for them to become their full creative boundless self and be in service of change on the planet.

### 2. Origin story

My journey started years ago when I had everything of the perfect life: a cool job in a famous company of documentary movies, working on cool projects, living in a cool apartment in Paris, but something profound was missing... I remember sitting at my computer desk, drawing Excel tables, often wondering if that was going to be my life. Deep inside, I knew there was something more… I wanted to discover, learn, move, feel… Soon enough I quit my job, left my apartment and booked a one-way ticket to travel the world. On the road, from country to country, I found myself.

Far from the office life, I shut off my rational mind, awakened my intuition, started to create art and completely changed the way I was approaching life. Guided by the signs and encounters, I met shamans and spiritual masters who lead me to perceive a whole new invisible realm. I was more alive than I had ever been.

The real journey started when I finally aknowledged that no matter how exciting my life was, how many countries I was traveling, how many projects I was creating, there was always in the background this underlying loneliness, anxiety and sadness that I was very good at masking with my “perfect girl” smile that I used since I was born. This was shown to me in my daily life through my coping mechanisms - food compulsion, nail biting, substance abuses… - and my most intimate relationships that were co-dependant and sometimes abusive.

I decided to commit to myself and my self-growth path, joining retreats and trainings, courses and mentorships. I wanted to uncover everything in me, see it all. What I discovered was not all light and love.

I went deep down into what some call « the Dark Night of the Soul ». I stripped away everything I thought I knew about myself, shed more tears than in my entire life, died many times to myself, broke my heart a few times, lost confidence, lost hope. All the veils were falling one by one as I was really seeing myself for the first time. I pierced through the illusion of the perfect childhood I thought I had, facing all the hurts, the violence, the traumas, the fears and unsafety feelings I experienced as a child and that shaped me as an adult.

With great dedication, I learned how to contemplate the deep layers of my being, witnessing any emotion, any sensation, any reaction, tracing their root, allowing, accepting, embracing. This led me to feel more, suffer less and above all to deeply love and accept myself.

I truly honor the absolute perfection of life and its unfolding, how everything has been - and still is - an opportunity to receive insights and transformation. As a consciousness seeker, I am constantly learning and unlearning with a beginner’s mind to keep on expanding and integrating.

My last transformative experience was to journey for a month and a half in the Amazon rainforest  following a deep training with the Yawanawa tribe in Brazil (called Dieta) with specific food restrictions, forest remedies and water deprivation. Those experiences are a way for me to mirror myself, integrate stronger resilience, receive inner wisdom and keep on shedding layers to create more spaciousness. 

I have committed to a lifelong journey of learning, to understand and overcome all barriers on the path towards absolute inner peace and harmony.

### 3. Philosophy and approach

My gift is to guide you navigating major life transitions and emotional crisis and support you identifying and releasing deep-rooted traumas and mental health issues.

I create spaces that facilitate profound transformation and reconnection with your heart, where you can learn how to love the woundest parts of you and embody your full empowered creative boundless self.

I was trained to a variety of modalities such as trauma therapy and Compassionate Inquiry with Gabor Maté, breathwork, mindfulness coaching, quantum healing, sound therapy, shamanism, voice liberation and psychedelic integration. I embodied all those teachings to create my own uniqueness where each tool is carefully chosen and designed to your uniqueness.

My approach is integrative, with a profound understanding of trauma, modern psychology and somatic-based therapy as well as a solid knowledge of energy healing, shamanism and ancient wisdom.

I am deeply devoted to witness and support your blossoming, believing in everyone’s ability to transform, create and thrive.

### 4. A Day in the Life

- I tend to be quite a hyper-productive person, always running a thousand projects at the same time. My house is also the place where I welcome people that are yearning to receive healing, to experience something new and find the safety of an inclusive community-centered space. Something is happening there each week: retreats, creative singing workshops, shamanic rituals, therapy sessions… It can get quite busy!
The rest of the days, I am spending time working on the creation of my future projects, developing the courses for Inner Ascend, taking care of my beautiful home, my dog, spending time with my partner, singing and improvising with my guitar…
    
    I aspire in time to learn to slow down more, honor my hermit-like nature and nurture my silent space.
    
- I start each of my days with a cleansing glass of warm water and a ginger lemon shot! Then I either do my morning practice with yoga, meditation and breathwork or spend time taking care of my garden.

### *5. Fun and Quirky Insights*

- Beneath my appeareances of an hyper-productive empowered woman, I am in fact an extra-sensitive person that needs a lot of calm and silence. That makes my life sometimes challenging as I am deeply sensitive to my environment, people’s feelings, sounds… I am also the softest heart in the world. I can not count how many times I felt in love. When I love, it is with all my being, deeply and intensely. Love has actually been my strongest catalyst for awakening. This is through being in love that I’ve became conscious of the true meaning of “the Divine” as well as Commitment, Devotion and Grace.
- **Superpower**:
    
    Flying with my giantic wings, feeling the lightness of my body, the perspective of the Eagle, the immensity of the blue sky! (I actually learnt how to fly with astral travelling - contact me and I’ll share my secret ;))
    

### *6. Wisdom for the Journey:*

- **What’s one piece of advice you’d give to someone on their path to enlightenment?**
    
    Self-love is everything. Learn to love all the parts of you, especially the ones you judge and shame the most. Each Piece of You contributes to the richness of who you are, making you perfectly imperfect, whole and unique.
    
    The areas we often judge or feel ashamed of, those hidden corners of our psyche that we tend to burry, are typically the ones yearning for our love and acceptance. By confronting and acknowledging these parts with compassion and understanding, we allow them to come into the light.
    
    So, to all of you that are walking the path to enlightenment…
    Be kind and patient with yourself while penetrating and sharp when it comes to your healing. You are in a work-in-progress, and every step you take, whether it feels like success or a setback, is an integral part of your journey of transformation. And above all: cultivate a deep, abiding love for yourself. Nourish it daily. Allow it to heal and guide you, shaping your journey in its most authentic form. Love yourself fully and watch how that love transforms you and the world around you.

### *7. Looking Ahead:*

- **What excites you most about the future of Inner Ascend?**

What truly excited me about Inner Ascend's future is our shared vision of growing a community. This is not only a place to learn and grow but a global platform aimed at creating meaningful heartfelt connections. This essence of restablishing authentic bonds with ourselves and with others, is, in my view, the ultimate form of healing. I'm especially enthusiastic about the upcoming Inner Ascend Practitioner Training program. This unique offering aims to impart transformative wisdom and practical tools for self-inquiry and healing processes, and preparing future practitioners who aspire to serve the world.

- **How do you envision your role evolving as the community grows?**

I have a very creative and visionary role at Inner Ascend. In close collaboration with Nina, I am passionately involved in designing a potent curriculum with a variety of impactful courses and enriching content for our platform. Our goal is to spark a transformative journey for our ever-growing community. 

Drawing from my extensive expertise in a variety of practices, my aspiration is to infuse our offerings with that versatility, diversity and depht and explore a multitude of horizons and perspectives - from grounded trauma work and modern psychology to the metaphysical aspects of energy healing, quantum physics, and burgeoning discoveries in consciousness - our curriculum aims to provide a comprehensive and wholistic understanding of the world.
