# Internal Workshop Guide

This guide should provide you with the basic navigation and facilitation skills needed for Inner Ascend membership events. Our aim is to create a seamless, engaging, and beneficial experience for all members. Let's work together to make each event successful!

### **Pre-Session Checklist**

1. **Google Meet Link**: Our dedicated Google Meet link for all membership events is: [https://meet.google.com/uix-mjvk-oqy](https://meet.google.com/uix-mjvk-oqy) This link is the one set up for the month of April. A new link will be generated each new month. Make sure you bookmark this link for easy access. To host the events, in order to record, you will have to access with this email

Please beware this is an admin account (gmail, docs, etc)
2. **Tech-Check**: It's crucial that you verify the functionality of your video and sound before the event. Using headphones is highly recommended for better sound quality.
3. **Background and Lighting**: Ensure that your background is as neutral as possible with good lighting.
4. **Arrival Time**: As a facilitator, please connect to the Zoom link at least 15 minutes before the event start time.

### **During the Session**

1. **Waiting Room**: Set up a waiting room before the event starts, displaying the event's image, title, your name as the facilitator, and duration of the event.
2. **Recording**: If it has been decided that the event will be recorded, make sure to hit the recording button.
3. **Admit Participants**: Only allow participants to enter from the waiting room at the correct start time.
4. **Introduction**: Start each session with a short appealing introduction of the event. Depending on the nature of the event, this could be followed by a short attunement/opening meditation and, a round of introductions and check-ins from participants.
5. **Time Management**: Be mindful of the clock throughout the session, and try to end on time.

### **Post-Session Protocol**

1. **Closing Remarks**: Always conclude the event by announcing upcoming live events and any  special announcements for the Inner Ascend platform.
2. **Incident Reporting**: If any issue arises during the session - technical difficulties, concerns with member(s), worries about a member's mental health state etc. - please report these immediately to the team following the session. It's vital we ensure the safety and wellbeing of our community members, and we value your insights as a facilitator.

### **Additional Tips**

- Try to build a personal connection with the participants by engaging in friendly conversation.
- Be approachable and open to participant's questions and concerns.
- Use the 'mute all' option when not in a discussion to minimize background noise.
- Be patient, compassionate, and open - some participants may be new to the platform or the practices being offered.
- In case of technical difficulties, reach out immediately to our support team for assistance.
