# Parts

- I'm developing a mobile app with react native and react native web, I need to develop the database structure, backend in nodejs, for this app, this app is going to be a hollistic practitioner swap app, where people can swap directly or indirectly with other users, indirectly meaning they can get a token back for a service, so they can exchange it with someone else, do you have any clarification questions before we start?
- Database: Do you have a preference for a particular database system? Are you thinking about using a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Firestore?
    - MySQL sounds good
- User Profiles: What information do you plan to capture for user profiles? I presume basic information like name, email, and professional expertise will be captured, but would you also include information about their availability, location, or ratings/reviews from past exchanges?
    - List of professions, select multiple, categories
    - Bio (small text)
    - Location
    - Availability later (when for booking and calendar)
    - Offerings list, and on offerings, the reviews (ratings) which are filtered to the profile
- Services: Can you provide more details on the types of services that will be offered and swapped on the platform? Will they be predefined or will users be able to create their own?
    - The offerings are created by people, you swap on the person, the offerings rely on categories(professions, reiki, energy healing, yoga, etc)
- Tokens: Can you elaborate more on the token system? How is the value of a token calculated? Is it universal for all services or does it differ based on the type and complexity of service?
    - The person can select the value of the offering, from 1/3 of a total, so 3 levels to offerings, from low, to mid, to high.
- Indirect Swapping: If a user gets a token for a service, how can they use it to exchange with someone else? Will there be a marketplace or a system for posting services you're willing to exchange for tokens?
    - You will scroll a profile list with users and select the one you want to swap or request an offering from, you will then give a token to them, or the value agreed for the offering
- Search and Match: What mechanisms are you envisioning for users to search and match with other users for swaps?
    - Instagram kind of feed, you search by category, location, keyword
- Privacy and Security: What are your expectations for data privacy and security? This can greatly affect the architecture of your backend.
    - GDPR and thats pretty much it
- User Interaction: How should users interact within the app? Would they need to connect and chat or exchange messages? Or will all interactions happen via service listings and swaps?
    - Service listings and request swap / indirect swap (its not indirect swap
- Service Listing: What kind of information will be displayed in a service listing? Does this include descriptions, estimated duration of service, required equipment or prerequisites, etc.?
- User Authentication: How do you plan to handle user authentication and authorization? Will it be a simple email-password setup, or are you considering social media logins as well? Do you plan on implementing multi-factor authentication for increased security?
- Ratings and Reviews: Are you planning to have a rating and review system for the services provided? If yes, what information would you like to capture?
- Moderation: How do you plan to manage and moderate the content that users will create, such as service descriptions, reviews, or messages to other users?
- In-app Purchases or Ads: Do you plan to incorporate in-app purchases or ads within the app for monetization?
- Scaling: Have you thought about how you want to handle growth and scaling in the future? Both the backend and the database need to be built with scaling in mind.
- Analytics: Are you planning to include any analytics to monitor user behavior or app performance?
- User Support: What kind of user support are you planning to offer? Do you need to build an interface for users to report issues or ask questions?
- Legal Considerations: Have you thought about the legal aspects, such as terms of use, privacy policy, and compliance with data protection laws?
