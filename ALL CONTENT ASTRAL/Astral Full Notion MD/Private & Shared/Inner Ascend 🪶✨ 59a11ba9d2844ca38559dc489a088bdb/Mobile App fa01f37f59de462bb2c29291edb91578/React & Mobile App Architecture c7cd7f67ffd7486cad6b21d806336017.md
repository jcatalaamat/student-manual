# React & Mobile App Architecture

- Node.js: As you've already decided, Node.js is a great choice for the backend. It's fast, scalable, and uses JavaScript which can be beneficial if your frontend is also using JavaScript (like React).
- Express.js: This is a web application framework for Node.js. It's minimal, flexible, and provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- MongoDB: These are databases you can use. MongoDB is a NoSQL database, if you need more flexibility with your data, go with MongoDB.
- Mongoose (if you choose MongoDB): This is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
- AWS S3: For storing videos and other static files.
- Socket.IO: For real-time communication like chat and notifications.

Frontend:

- Tamagui

Here's a high-level overview of Tamagui's architecture:

1. **Platform Agnostic Components**: Tamagui provides a set of pre-built components that are platform-agnostic. These components are built using primitives that abstract away the differences between platforms. This means you can use the same component code across different platforms.
2. **Styled System**: Tamagui uses styled-system for style props. Styled-system is a collection of utility functions that add style props to your React components and allows you to control their layout and typography, among other things.
3. **Styled Components**: Tamagui uses styled-components for creating styled React components. Styled-components allows you to write actual CSS in your JavaScript, keeping the component logic and styling in one place.
4. **Theme Support**: Tamagui supports theming, which allows you to define a set of colors, fonts, and other visual design attributes, and use them consistently across your app.
5. **Responsive Design**: Tamagui supports responsive design out of the box. You can easily create components that adapt their layout based on the screen size.
6. **Sketch Integration**: Tamagui also supports rendering your components in Sketch. This allows designers to use the same components that are used in the actual app.
