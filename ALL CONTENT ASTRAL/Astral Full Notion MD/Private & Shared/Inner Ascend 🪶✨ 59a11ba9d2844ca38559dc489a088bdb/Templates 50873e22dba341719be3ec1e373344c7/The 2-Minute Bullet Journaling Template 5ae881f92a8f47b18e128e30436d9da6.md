# The 2-Minute Bullet Journaling Template

In his habit tier list,¬†[Improvement Pill ranked](https://youtu.be/GriR73kSvPY)¬†bullet journalling #1 ‚Äî even above working out, reading, and meditation. This intrigued me enough to give it a solid shot.

**But who has the time or patience for page-long sections or tons of bullet points?**

So I improvised ‚Äî thanks to my 2-minute template, it‚Äôs effortless to stay consistent. And we all know consistency is the KING for success with any habit.

Over time, I've tweaked and honed my original template to a massive extent. I present the final result to you.

Hope this shoots your daily productivity and mental clarity to the skies.

# The Crucial Prerequisite:

For this template to work, you need to be *laser*-certain about your top 3 priorities. We‚Äôll use [Warren Buffet‚Äôs 5/25 rule](https://medium.com/ma-n-ximize/warren-buffetts-5-25-rule-will-sky-rocket-your-productivity-2a62d20fef58?sk=ee385783eaf7a1e5469b0969cfe63d15) (with a twist) to find them:

- List down 10 things that matter to you the most in life (now). Don‚Äôt overthink ‚Äî go off the top of your head.
    1. Inner Ascend
    2. Community
    3. Intentional Dialog
    4. Connecting with my family
    5. Healing my mother wound
    6. Selling my packages
    7. Singing
    8. Building stuff
    9. Singing
    10. Playing Guitar
- Add 7 more to the list. Now, you might need to think a bit.
    1. Spending time outside
    2. Getting sun
    3. Making a fire
    4. Spending time with the cats
    5. Healing my ancestors
- Wrack your brain and squeeze out another 8.
    1. 

Once you have 25 priorities written, start chopping them down:

- Strike out the 10 least important things.
- Left with 15? Cut out another 7 of your darlings.
- Last round ‚Äî murder another 3.

Buffett stops at 5 but we‚Äôll go a step further - lop off another 2. 

**The 3 you‚Äôre left with are your top 3 priorities.

*P.S.** No need ****to do this every day, week, or month. Once every 3 to 6 months is enough. So ensure you jot down long-term (6-12 month timeframe) goals. 

The below outdated photo serves as an example (Yes, not the best handwriting):*

![1_4WFRHRVC17kFVMbXeZPcOg.jpg](The%202-Minute%20Bullet%20Journaling%20Template%205ae881f92a8f47b18e128e30436d9da6/1_4WFRHRVC17kFVMbXeZPcOg.jpg)

**If and when you‚Äôre stable enough to have mostly-unchanging priorities in life, you can use ‚Äútimeless‚Äù priorities - instead of time-bound goals.**

For example, my current ‚Äútimeless‚Äù priorities are Writing, Family, and Online Business.

*P.S. Still, refresh your priorities at least once a year. Even the most ‚Äústable‚Äù of us change*

# Explaining The Template:

*P.S. This section is only an explanatory template. You‚Äôll find a duplicable template for daily journaling in the next section*

- **Your Priorities** (Repeat the *exact* same priorities every day ‚Üí To internalise them better):

*P.S. These are the same priorities you‚Äôd have found through the 3/25 rule in the previous section.*

- P0: _______________________
- P1:  _______________________
- P2: _______________________
- **The Day‚Äôs To-Do Items** (4 total items so we neither overcommit nor undercommit):

*P.S. If and when new P012 tasks pop up in the day, ignore or swap them with your planned tasks based on priority.* 

- P0 related:
    - Task 1: _______________________
    - Task 2: _______________________
- P1 related:
    - Task 3: _______________________
- P2 related:
    - Task 4: _______________________

*P.S. No P2 tasks? Add a 2nd P1 task. If there are no P1/P2 items, add a 3rd P0 Item for the day.*

- **Daily Gratitude** (Recall 3 people/things/events that made you smile the past 24 hours):

*P.S. On bad days, recall the blessings like we take for granted - like a roof over our head, loving family, and good food.*

- Grateful for _______________________
- Grateful for _______________________
- Grateful for _______________________

*P.S. When expressing gratitude, don‚Äôt just ‚Äúrecall‚Äù - RELIVE the memory in all its 5 senses. You‚Äôll feel genuine joy springing up.*

# 3 Ways To Journal With This Template:

### #1. **The Excellent Way:**

Journal by hand with pen and paper. It‚Äôs therapeutic and scientifically proven to be superior to digital journaling. 3 options again:

- **The Tedious Option:** Hand-copy the Priorities, ToDos, and Gratitude sections *daily* in a notebook or diary. I did this for a year before I got fed up and created an easier solution üëá
- **The Easy Option:** [Get the 2-Minute Bullet paperback Journal](https://the-2-minute-bullet-journal.carrd.co/). With a sleek design and pre-printed templated pages, it‚Äôll save you copy-pasting time + frustration.

- **The Midway Option:** Use a whiteboard if you have it. The pro? No need to hand-write the template. Con? No privacy - your tasks/gratitude are visible to others

### #2. **The Good Way:**

Journal digitally in your phone‚Äôs Notes app - or on Notion with the daily-use template below:

### #3. **The ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù Way:**

On days you‚Äôre running late or in a hurry, journal ‚Äúmentally‚Äù or on any paper scrap.

*P.S. This is NOT an excuse to skip journaling. Use this only on days you genuinely cannot journal.*

# 6 Tips/Tricks/Guidelines For Optimal Results

- **Stack journaling atop existing habits** ‚Üí I journal right after my [morning routine](https://rebrand.ly/god-mode) of [workout](https://rebrand.ly/nzcfg0e) + [cold shower](https://medium.com/in-fitness-and-in-health/5-unusual-tiny-tweaks-to-make-cold-showers-even-more-powerful-1241783214a3?sk=2aa01ae1db4fd4ba301aa4c918c41219) + Pranayama + [meditation](https://betterhumans.pub/one-easy-technique-helped-me-meditate-deeply-when-nothing-else-worked-6c825788c38f).
- **Bullet-journal either at the start or end of your work day** ‚Üí The former provides solid morning motivation. The latter lets your subconscious mull over your tasks as you‚Äôre asleep.

- **Create a day-to-day task ‚Äúflow‚Äù** ‚Üí Don‚Äôt feel guilty over left-over tasks - ‚Äúpour‚Äù them over to the next day and keep the chain going.

*P.S. If you consistently have left-over tasks, you‚Äôre setting unrealistic tasks. Dial back. Conversely, if you‚Äôre easily ticking off all your tasks, set harder + bigger tasks.* 
****

- **Repeat the [3/25 exercise](The%202-Minute%20Bullet%20Journaling%20Template%205ae881f92a8f47b18e128e30436d9da6.md) every 3-6 months** ‚Üí to see if your priorities have changed. But no sooner than 3 months - that‚Äôs why the [90-day paperback journal](https://the-2-minute-bullet-journal.carrd.co/) uses the 3/25 rule only once.
- **This template isn‚Äôt set in stone ‚Üí** Once you develop a solid journaling habit, modify/enhance this template to better suit your needs.
- **The longer and more consistently you journal, the more powerful the habit gets. Period.**
