# Instagram

## **Step 1: Clean up your feed**

Ok, this will be a bit different from YouTube as it’s not effective to list EVERYONE you follow on IG.

1. Set a timer for 10 minutes
2. Scroll your Instagram feed
3. For each post, ask yourself “Is this providing meaningful value to me and my goals?”
4. If the answer is **“no”**, consider unfollowing or muting that creator
5. If the answer is **“yes”**, consider favoriting that creator
6. Do the same steps with Stories if you consistently engage with those

(if your feed is extra messy, do it twice)
