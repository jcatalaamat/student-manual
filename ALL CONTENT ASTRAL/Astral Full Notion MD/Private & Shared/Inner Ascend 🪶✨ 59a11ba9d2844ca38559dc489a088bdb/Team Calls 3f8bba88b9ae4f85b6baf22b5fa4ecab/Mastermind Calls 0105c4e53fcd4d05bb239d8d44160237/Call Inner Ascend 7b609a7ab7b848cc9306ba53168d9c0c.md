3 first months = membership open to everyone.

- donation based to fund the project
- crowd funding campain - founding members - benefits when people donate to us
- its all about community
- this time is for building a following / being seen
- so it would be great to make a list for each person of what we can offer as contribution back to donations, those "freebies" . can be discounts on sessions, retreats, free contents such as free meditations, free free journeys, free songbooks

- [ ]  Write a few lines about themes, cycles, seasons. How can we invite nuances into Inner Ascend?

Yearly cycle 

Being in synch with our solar system is helping build our connection to the divine. 
It’s already happening so basically it’s just making the most out of our current circumstances by learning more about them and being intentional.

- I believe the Zodiac wheel is a system that’s pretty complete and holistic and we could gain from using its symbols as points of focus for our offerings each month. It’s like a cosmic roadmap for complete individuation, it allows us to focus on different aspects of our psyche.
- Nature’s seasonal cycle is also amazing to work with and can also be scaled monthly and daily.

Monthly

We could follow the same logic about Moon cycles, to go through monthly cycles on top of our yearly zodiac and seasonal cycles. The specific flavour of each full moon and new moon adds specific intentions to the moon cycle’s powers. 

Tarot’s journey

The major arcana are telling the story of the Fool, from begging to the end of a complete cycle. It talks about all the steps we go through through each cycle and it could be an amazing tool to work through a complete cycle together.
