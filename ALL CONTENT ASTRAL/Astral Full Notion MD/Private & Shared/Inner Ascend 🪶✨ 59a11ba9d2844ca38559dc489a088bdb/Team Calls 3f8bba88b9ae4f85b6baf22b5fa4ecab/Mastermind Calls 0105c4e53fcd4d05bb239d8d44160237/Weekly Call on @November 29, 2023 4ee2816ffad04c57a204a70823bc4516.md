# Intention / Direction

For our first session, it would be amazing if you could come with a clear idea of what you're aiming to achieve. We'll be sharing our experiences, challenges, and insights, to empower each other on our individual paths towards our greater purpose.

1. **Purpose:** A short description of your main aim or passion. This is your big-picture goal, the reason you're seeking support or guidance.
2. **Challenges:** Any obstacles or issues you're currently facing that are affecting your progress. These could be external issues like a lack of resources, or internal ones like self-doubt or fear.
3. **Needs/Support:** Understand what you're wishing to get from our group.. This could include feedback on a specific issue, resources or connections, or just someone to hold you accountable.
4. **Open Heart and Mind:** Be ready to share your experiences honestly and openly, and to offer and receive support.

Remember, this is a group effort. We all benefit when everyone participates actively and is willing to both give and take advice.

Thank you for your time and willingness to participate. I'm looking forward to our first session, take care and stay inspired.
