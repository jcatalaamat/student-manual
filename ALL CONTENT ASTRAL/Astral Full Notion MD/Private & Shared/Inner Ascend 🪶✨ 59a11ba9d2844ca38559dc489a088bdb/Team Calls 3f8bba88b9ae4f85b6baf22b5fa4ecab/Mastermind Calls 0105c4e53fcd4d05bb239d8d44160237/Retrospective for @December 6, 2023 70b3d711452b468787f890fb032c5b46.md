# ðŸ™Œ What went well

- @Alexa Ele â€” brainstorming community/ tribe
- @Alina RÃ¶sken â€” Its magical to see how we slowly move closer energetically as a group.

# ðŸŒ± What needs improvement

- @Alexa Ele â€” like the idea of Ally
- @Alina RÃ¶sken â€” I would love to discuss a fixed structure. Perhaps one of us does the opening every Wednesday and we rotate on that? e.g. Meditation/Grounding, short check in, focus on homework and having one person ask a question for each sharing

# ðŸ’¡Â Ideas for what to do differently

- @Alina RÃ¶sken â€” Focus on what went well and taking action from that

# ðŸ’¡Â Accountability / Support
