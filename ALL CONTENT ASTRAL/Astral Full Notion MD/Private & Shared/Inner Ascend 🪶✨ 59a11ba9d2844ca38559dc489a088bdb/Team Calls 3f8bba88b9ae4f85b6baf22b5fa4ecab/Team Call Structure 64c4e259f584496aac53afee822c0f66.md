# Team Call Structure

# Who?

Each Wednesday the opening of our Mastermind Call will be lead by someone else. Ideally we rotate or the person that feels called to guide us will step up in the Whatsapp Group beforehand. 

# What?

- Meditation, breathing or other practice with the intention to ground and call in presence.
- Short check-in with the group members e.g. “Give me one word that describes how you feel right now”, “Describe your week in one sentence”. Whatever you feel is most aligned 😇
- The call could be then focussed on each of us presenting the homework and having one person that feels called to ask a question on that sharing. That way we are receiving some guidance or clarity already before we hop on additional Saturday calls.
- Brainstorming on ideas for next weeks call
