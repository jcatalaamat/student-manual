# New Inner Ascend

*Inner Ascend* is a platform dedicated to nurturing growth and advancement in the field of holistic practices. It provides an inclusive environment where curious learners, practicing professionals, and highly experienced practitioners converge to explore, refine, and master holistic practices. Its structure and offerings reflect a deep commitment to continual learning, mutual support, and the application of holistic principles.

Within *Inner Ascend*, we have four (five?) distinct groups each with a unique role and experience level:

1. *New Members*: These are individuals newly introduced to Inner Ascend through various channels - be it the Explorer Membership, Mastermind Groups, standalone courses and trainings, or the comprehensive Super Practitioner Training. New members, as they discover the value and enriching experiences of Inner Ascend's offerings, may progress to becoming Explorer, Mastermind, or even Collective Members, adding to the vibrant growth of our nurturing community.
2. *Explorer Members*: These are individuals interested in exploring the world of holistic practices. They participate in 'The Explorer Membership,' an affordable platform offering workshops and events that serve as an entry point into their personal growth journey. These offerings are facilitated primarily by Mastermind Members. They can also choose to deepen their exploration by enrolling in any of Inner Ascend's various courses and trainings.
3. *Mastermind Members*: Mastermind Members are holistic practitioners looking to refine and expand their skills. They serve the Explorer Members by hosting workshops and events as part of 'The Explorer Membership,' providing a practical and interactive avenue for skill refinement and professional development. They also have the option to participate in Inner Ascend's other courses and trainings. This flexibility ensures that they continually grow as they guide others on their journey.
4. *Collective Members (aka The Collective)*: The Collective constitutes the most dedicated members who have successfully completed Inner Ascend's intensive Super Practitioner Training. They not only contribute to the Explorer Membership and lead their own Mastermind Group, but also play an integral role in offering full courses, facilitating intensive training, and steering the strategic direction of Inner Ascend.
5. *Inner Circle(?)*: This group represents the guiding lights of Inner Ascend. Comprising the original or founding members, they hold a special role in maintaining the vision and guiding principles of the platform. They're not only part of The Collective but also hold a unique role that is recognized and respected within the community.

*Super Practitioner Training*

In addition to these member groups, Inner Ascend provides an extensive Super Practitioner Training that consists of two transformative levels:

- *Level 1*: A deep dive into self-shadow work, this stage focuses on personal healing and transformation.
- *Level 2*: After successfully completing Level 1, students can advance to become certified holistic practitioners through an intensive skill-building program.

The most exceptional students who successfully complete both levels of this rigorous training are invited to become *Collective Members*. This not only greatly enhances the breadth and depth of Inner Ascend's offerings, but also underlines our commitment to fostering an environment of ongoing growth and development.

*Founding Members: The Pillars of Inner Ascend*
Beyond the member groups and Collective, we recognize a special category - the *Founding Members*. These individuals can be Collective Members who have taken on significant responsibility and shown exceptional dedication in supporting Inner Ascend's growth.

*The Collective as The Mastermind*
Consideration: The Collective effectively represents the Mastermind Group. Becoming part of the Collective is more than just an exclusive privilege, it's an evolved state of dedication within the community. Collective Members have access to certain benefits associated with the DAO or organisation, including participation in governance processes.

However, it's important to note that joining the Collective doesn't automatically guarantee that members can offer their services under the Inner Ascend umbrella. The approval for offerings would still require a decision either by the founding team or through a collective vote, where founding members may have a stronger voice. This structure ensures that all offerings align with Inner Ascend's principles and overall community benefit.
