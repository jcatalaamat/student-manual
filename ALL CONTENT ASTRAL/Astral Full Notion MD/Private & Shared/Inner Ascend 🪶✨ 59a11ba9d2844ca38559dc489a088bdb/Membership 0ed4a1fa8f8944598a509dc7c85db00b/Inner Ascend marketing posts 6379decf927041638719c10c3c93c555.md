### PRIVATE GROUPS

Dearest friends & family,

I am so excited to share with you our last creation: Inner Ascend, ***an online platform for seekers, healers, and dreamers***.

- **Kicking off from 1ST OF APRIL**, we have been putting our heart and soul since months to create this vision and bring together our global family for shared growth and healing.

By joining us for ***only 33â‚¬ / month***, you gain access to a ***multitude of live events and a nurturing community space***.

We've gathered a special team of facilitators who've delved deeply into their respective healing paths and will share their tools and expertise with our community.

The essence of Inner Ascend is to nurture and deepen the bonds we've created with each of you. I hope to reconnect with many of you and form new connections as we learn and grow together.
