## Title: **CLOSER TO TRUTH**

Short description: 

In this container, your perceptions are been freed from all conditionings preventing you from seeing the truth, believing in yourself and trusting the Universe. Every week, you have the opportunity to cleanse a notion that has a big impact on your everyday life, setting you more and more free.

Description:

INTRO

In Closer to Truth, Natasha guides you to connect with your subconscious perceptions, in order to free them from outdated emotions, traumatising experiences or limiting beliefs. This practice is based on the idea that Truth is pure consciousness and therefore pure love and potentiality. Seeing the truth allows you to go beyond your limitations, therefore to be more loving of yourself and one another.

WHAT

In a state between meditation and hypnosis, and with the intention to see the Truth, it is through visions, thoughts, sensations, that all conditionings preventing you from thriving will be brought to light and be freed. 

Through loving presence, conscious breath, EFT and affirmations, and thanks to your body‚Äôs natural capacity to self regulate, you will be guided through emotional releases all the way to a peaceful state. 

WHO

This event is for you if :
You would like to meditate more and be more in touch with your subconscious self

You feel limited and constricted by your perception of yourself or by the world around you

You would like to have a regular cleansing practice to actualise yourself, releasing past experiences and outdated emotions.

Let yourself be surprised by what changes presence and intention can bring! 

WHEN

## **Title: CHAKRA GUARDIANS**

Short description:

Every two weeks, join us for a colorful adventure through the chakra system, and meet the spirit animal whose medicine would benefit you the most to activate, reenergise and heal each one of your main energetical centers. 

Description:

INTRO

The language of the subconscious mind is one of images and symbolism. Just like a dream, a guided vision quest allows deep and powerful changes within your psyche. We are working with the symbolism of the 7 main chakras and the animal reign, put together for a meaningful healing of your whole system throughout the weeks.

WHAT & HOW

This is a guided meditation. We start with a quick sharing circle for everyone to deliver what‚Äôs present. Then we enter a relaxed meditative state, and we start the journey all the way through the heart of a specific chakra. There, we summon the animal that is willing to share with us its medicine, its strengths and qualities, those that would best serve us in activating, balancing and healing the chosen chakra. After getting familiar with it, we give thanks to the spirit animal and we come back to our senses. After a few moments of recentering, we end the session with another sharing circle, to help integrating the experience.

WHO

This is for you if:

You appreciate stories and images, travel to fantastic worlds

You want to focus on your chakra system and maybe learn more about each chakra center

You want to feel supported and tap in the strengths and qualities that are already within you

You want to learn to interact with parts of yourself through the shape of symbolic beings

WHEN

April, Thursday 11th 19:00 - 20:30
