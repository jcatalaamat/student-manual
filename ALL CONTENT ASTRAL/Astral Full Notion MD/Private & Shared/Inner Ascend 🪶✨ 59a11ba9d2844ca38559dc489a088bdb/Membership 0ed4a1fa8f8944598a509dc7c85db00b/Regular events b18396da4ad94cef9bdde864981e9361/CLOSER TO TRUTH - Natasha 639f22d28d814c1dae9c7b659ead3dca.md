Title: **CLOSER TO TRUTH**

Short description: 

In this container, your perceptions are been freed from all conditionings preventing you from seeing the truth, believing in yourself and trusting the Universe. Every week, you have the opportunity to cleanse a notion that has a big impact on your everyday life, setting you more and more free.

Description:

INTRO

In Closer to Truth, Natasha guides you to connect with your subconscious perceptions, in order to free them from outdated emotions, traumatising experiences or limiting beliefs. This practice is based on the idea that Truth is pure consciousness and therefore pure love and potentiality. Seeing the truth allows you to go beyond your limitations, therefore to be more loving of yourself and one another.

WHAT

In a state between meditation and hypnosis, and with the intention to see the Truth, it is through visions, thoughts, sensations, that all conditionings preventing you from thriving will be brought to light and be freed. 

Through loving presence, conscious breath, EFT and affirmations, and thanks to your bodyâ€™s natural capacity to self regulate, you will be guided through emotional releases all the way to a peaceful state.
