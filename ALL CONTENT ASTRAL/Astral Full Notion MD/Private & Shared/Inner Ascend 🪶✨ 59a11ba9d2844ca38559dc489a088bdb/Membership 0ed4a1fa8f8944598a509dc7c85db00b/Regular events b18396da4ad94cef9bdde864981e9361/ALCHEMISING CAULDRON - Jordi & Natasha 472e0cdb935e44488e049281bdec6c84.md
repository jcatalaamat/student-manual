INTRO

Welcome to your weekly group healing session, where the magic of each one of us deeply infuses in this cauldron, to create a very unique healing potion. 

As we hold space for you to share your story, your doubts and your feelings, we will attune to our intuition and sharp sense of empathy to see and feel through your energy, and thus bring you the support that’s the most adapted to your needs.

From channeled insights, teachings, grounded practices and essential loving intentions, your healing happens in an active and passive way all at the same time. Come as you are, let the magic unfold.

“I heal by being in loving presence and being held”

WHAT

The Alchemising Cauldron is a trauma informed support group, based on a holistic and integrative healing approach. We work with energies, emotions, in order to rebalance the whole Being, reuniting body with spirit where it’s unaligned.

INTENTION

The Alchemising Cauldron allows you to increase your connection to yourself, to Source and to each other. We aim to develop a greater understanding of things, of existence itself, that allows healing on a deeper level. We do so by reactivating energy flow, releasing any blocks. 

HOW

We start each call with a grounding meditation to center the energy, set the intention of bringing light and freeing what can be freed, and receiving the breakthroughs that are ready to be shared.

Your questions and problematics will be adressed through ou vision and intuition, to find a direction, a blueprint. You can come with any issue - relationship, childhood trauma, spirituality, self-love…

We hold space in a loving way as you experience emotional release - fear, sadness, anger, disgust, shame, guilt… and you will be guided through some nervous system regulation practices to go back to a relaxed state.

We focus on lower chakras to build good and clear foundations, and we focus on higher chakras to channel greater understandings that can then be integrated to clear the body from all stagnant stuff

You are building resilience and trust, embodying new truths.

We operate through active listening - seeing through, feeling through what is going on.

The healing occurs through our channeling, our teachings, our grounded practices and of course the energy of the group.

WHO

This is the place for you if:

You are feeling foggy, stuck, you are seeking guidance, comfort, love

You are willing to grow and transform deeply

You are willing to connect more - to yourself, to one another, to God.

You will be seen and held. 

We practice unconditional love and radical acceptance.
