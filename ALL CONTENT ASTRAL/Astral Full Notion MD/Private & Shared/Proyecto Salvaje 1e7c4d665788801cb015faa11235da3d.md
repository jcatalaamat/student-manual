# Proyecto Salvaje

## **1. Executive Summary**

**Mission:** We are creating a regenerative village and living school dedicated to restoring human dignity, sovereignty, and sacred relationship with the Earth through community, education, healing, and embodied remembrance.

**Location:** Our land is located on the Pacific coast of Oaxaca, Mexico, where the Sierra Madre mountains meet the ocean. It is part of a rich ecological corridor, neighboring natural reserves, mangroves, and lagoon systems. The land covers approximately 12 acres (about 5 hectares) of fertile soil, with access to natural water sources, lush vegetation, and a diversity of native trees. It is nestled in a rural agricultural zone near the town of Mazunte, offering both seclusion for deep regenerative work and connection to an already vibrant community of healers, visionaries, and land stewards.

**Project Overview:** We are establishing an intentional, regenerative community in Oaxaca, Mexico — a sanctuary that integrates a healing village, a living school, and an educational center. This space is dedicated to protecting human integrity and sovereign birthrights: freedom, bodily autonomy, spiritual self-determination, and the right to live in harmony with nature. Our aim is to provide an immersive environment where individuals and families can engage in transformative practices, learn sustainable living skills, and participate in communal healing, all while fostering a deep connection with the Earth.

**Unique Value:** Unlike typical retreat centers or new-age communities, we are building a regenerative sanctuary that defends human sovereignty, tends collective trauma, reclaims sacred living through decolonized, community-led resilience — and stands as a living school to educate, empower, and preserve the essence of humanity beyond profit-driven wellness.

**Funding Required:** First round 700K, second round 1M.

**Use of Funds:**

- **Land Restoration and Permaculture Development:** Soil regeneration, reforestation with native species, creation of food forests, and installation of water management systems (Year 1–3).
- **Eco-Infrastructure Construction:** Building of 20 natural homes, a communal kitchen, educational spaces, ceremonial areas, and renewable energy systems (solar, rainwater collection) (Year 1–2).
- **Immersive Educational Programs Setup:** Curriculum development, educational infrastructure for the living school, facilitation training, and equipment (Year 2).
- **DAO Development and ReFi Integration:** Launching the DAO for community governance, token creation, impact tracking infrastructure, and decentralized funding models (Year 1–2).
- **Community Building and Marketing:** Slow organic brand building, educational storytelling, DAO community growth, and intentional outreach to aligned members, not mass-market advertising (Year 2–3).
- **Foundational Team and Operations:** Salaries for core team members (permaculture stewards, builders, facilitators, operational guardians), administration, legal setup, and coordination (Year 1–3).
- **Resilience and Emergency Fund:** Reserve capital for unforeseen challenges, ensuring project continuity and financial resilience (across all three years).

**Return on Investment:** In a collapsing world, founding stewards choose regeneration over extraction. Their return is not financial — it is eternal: a sanctuary built by human hands, rooted in truth, rising in defiance of a dying system.

Founding Stewards are not traditional investors seeking financial profit — they are visionary allies, co-creating a living sanctuary for future generations. Their reward is deeper, sacred, and eternal.

By contributing to the foundation of this regenerative sanctuary, Founding Stewards receive:

**1. Founding Steward Recognition**

- Permanent acknowledgment as a co-creator of the sanctuary's origin.
- "Founding Guardian" Certificate (physical and digital) honoring their sacred role.
- Name engraved (with consent) on a Founders' Wall or sacred tree memorial on the land.

**2. Lifetime Community Access**

- Priority access to events, retreats, and programs.
- Discounts on stays, gatherings, and educational offerings for life.
- Exclusive invitations to annual Founders' Gatherings at the sanctuary.

**3. Governance Participation (DAO)**

- Membership in the Founders' Circle DAO — a council of stewards who hold ceremonial and advisory voice over key directions.
- The ability to propose initiatives, advise on partnerships, and guard the sanctuary's founding principles through decentralized processes.

**4. Personal Connection to Regeneration**

- Annual impact reports showing how their contribution is restoring ecosystems, empowering youth, regenerating culture, and honoring sacred Earth relationships.
- Optional direct involvement in land regeneration projects, community councils, or educational program development.

**5. Sacred Belonging**

- The invisible but eternal reward: belonging to a living lineage of restoration, standing as guardians of dignity, freedom, and the original instructions on how to live.

## **2. Vision and Mission**

### **Vision**

To protect human dignity, sovereign birthrights, and sacred living by creating a living sanctuary where people heal, learn, and live in regenerative harmony with the Earth — planting seeds of true community for future generations.

### **Mission**

We are building an intentional regenerative community — a healing village, a real-life school, and an educational sanctuary — that empowers self-sufficiency, emotional integrity, collective healing, and spiritual sovereignty.

Through land regeneration, decolonized education, sacred remembrance, and decentralized self-governance, we are restoring humanity's original instructions: to live in reciprocity with each other, the Earth, and the sacred.

Our sanctuary serves as a refuge, a seedbed of human wholeness, and a beacon of right relationship for a collapsing world.

### **Core Values**

| **Value** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Regeneration | Healing ecosystems, cultures, and communities to restore sacred balance. |
| Sovereignty | Defending bodily, emotional, spiritual, and communal self-determination. |
| Sacred Stewardship | Living in right relationship with the Earth, ancestors, and each other. |
| Transparency | Acting with honesty, accountability, and open-hearted governance. |
| Decentralized Community | Organizing life collectively, cooperatively, and without reliance on external power structures. |
| Equity & Decolonization | Honoring indigenous wisdom, repairing systemic harm, and creating inclusive pathways for all. |
| Truth & Dignity | Holding unwavering commitment to human integrity, emotional honesty, and the defense of life. |

## **3. Why This Sanctuary Is Necessary Now**

We are stepping out of the over-capitalization of the wellness industry by prioritizing community-driven growth, equitable access, and mutual support over profit. We are witnessing the fall of new-age spirituality and the collapse of hollow spiritual consumerism.

We are looking for a third way — one focused on the human factor: on how to heal, support, and stand with each other in reciprocity with the Earth.

This sanctuary exists to:

- Resist dehumanization
- Shelter those defending truth and dignity
- Reclaim the original instructions on how to live in community and equilibrium
- Redefine togetherness, sovereignty, and service

## **4. Land, Infrastructure, and Facilities**

### **The Land**

The project is being birthed in Oaxaca, Mexico, a country carrying a powerful lineage of indigenous rights, cultural resistance, and ancestral knowledge. Our 12-acre land lies on the Pacific coast near Mazunte, a region already rich in collective initiatives, land regeneration, and holistic practices.

- Bordered by natural reserve, lagoon, and mangroves
- Old-growth trees, flat and hilly areas, perfect for permaculture
- Access to water, electricity, and private road
- Zoned for 20 eco-homes and capacity for ~40 residents
- One hour from international airport, connected by highway

## **6. Market and Customer Analysis**

### **Global Trends Supporting Our Sanctuary**

The sanctuary is a strategic, essential, and inevitable response to intersecting global crises. Our project aligns with several powerful and rising movements:

| **Trend** | **What It Means** |
| --- | --- |
| Global Collapse & Systemic Distrust | People are losing trust in governments, institutions, and the dominant system. They are seeking sovereign, off-grid, emotionally grounded communities. |
| Rise of Regenerative Living | People are no longer satisfied with sustainability — they want regeneration: healing land, culture, and spirit. |

| Decentralized Living & Web3 Culture | The ReFi (Regenerative Finance), crypto, and DAO movements are creating real-life experiments in post-capitalist cooperation and decentralized governance. |
| Mental Health & Somatic Healing Explosion | There is a tidal wave of demand for trauma-informed spaces, nervous system education, emotional healing, and sacred medicine integration. |
| Post-Spiritual Consumer Awakening | People are leaving new-age capitalism, bypass culture, and spiritual commodification in search of real, earth-rooted, decolonized spiritual connection. |

### **Why This Sanctuary is Not Just Wanted — It's Necessary**

In a collapsing world, spaces like this become essential infrastructure for human survival and reorientation.

We are not selling retreats — we are offering a shelter, a re-skilling center, a resistance camp for the soul.

This sanctuary will serve as:

- A gathering ground for awakened humans seeking to live differently
- A shelter from toxic cities, coercive systems, and spiritual despair
- A training ground for post-collapse living, emotional resilience, and regenerative culture
- A space of remembrance — where indigenous wisdom, earth connection, and communal truth are kept alive

- Residents and digital members must align with founding values
- Yearly contribution from land residents covers shared costs
- External DAO members can support, govern, and co-create from anywhere in the world

## **9. Founding Members & Land Stewardship Model**

We are now calling in a circle of Founding Members — the humans who will root, hold, and protect this sanctuary as it comes to life.

Founding Members are not just donors or early residents — they are guardians of the vision, committed to living in alignment with the values of regeneration, sovereignty, integrity, and emotional truth. They are those who will co-create the cultural DNA, hold responsibility, and tend the land as a living being.

This circle includes two essential strands:

- Those who have been with the project from the beginning, often with lower income but deep presence — contributing time, vision, and early financial offerings to secure the land itself.
- Those who are arriving to co-hold the project, bringing in larger capital, skills, and structure to help build and stabilize the sanctuary for the long term.

To ensure true commitment and protect the collective, all founding stewards will contribute in some form — whether through financial capital, land security, sweat equity, or long-term presence.

Some members who have contributed early funds to secure the land will receive ownership or long-term use rights accordingly — through clear ethical agreements that preserve the land's purpose. Others entering later may purchase land use rights and help fund the eco-infrastructure, systems, and structures.

Land is never for speculative resale, but it may be personally inhabited, cultivated, and tended. Each founding steward may build a home, co-create shared spaces, and take root — with alignment to shared guidelines and sacred trust agreements.

### **Contribution Model:**

| **Path** | **Role** | **Contribution** | **Rights & Participation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Early Founders | Already involved in land or vision | Contribution already made (land security, vision, roots) | Land use and/or ownership rights based on prior investment; equal voice in DAO |
| Anchor Stewards | Full-time residents | $100,000–$150,000 USD | Private land plot, home-building rights, DAO membership, lifetime residency |
| Core Contributors | Part-time or shared housing | $50,000–$75,000 USD | Shared eco-home, co-creation roles, DAO access, seasonal stay |
| Vision Allies | Off-site support circle | $10,000–$25,000 USD | Governance voice, ceremonial recognition, lifetime access and invitations |

All contributions are non-refundable and are considered a sacred investment into the Earth, the future, and the sanctuary's purpose.

Agreements are structured through the Mexican NGO and DAO, ensuring legal clarity and transparent governance while protecting the land from commodification.

### **Becoming a Founding Member:**

Each path begins with:

- A values-based dialogue and interview
- Agreement on land use, contribution, and culture
- Participation in DAO governance
- Optional on-site immersion or orientation for residency roles

## **10. Ethical Legal Structure & Protection for All Stewards**

We are building a legal structure that not only governs the sanctuary — it protects everyone who contributes to it. Whether your investment is monetary, energetic, or time-based, this community will be structured to honor and safeguard your offering.

This is not just a legal framework — it is a soul agreement in practical form.

We are ensuring:

**1. Equity of Contribution**

- Those who contribute early energy, land work, and presence are recognized and protected
- Those who contribute funds receive clear agreements, transparent ownership, and full DAO access
- Every steward, regardless of wealth, has a voice and a role in the sanctuary's future

**2. Rightful Ownership of Homes & Land**

- Anyone who contributes toward land and construction costs will legally own their plot and eco-home through clear contracts held by the NGO or a trust structure
- There will be no speculative real estate — only rooted, life-aligned, shared ownership governed by sacred agreements

**3. Legal Protection for All Members**

- All agreements will be backed by a Mexican nonprofit and DAO-enabled governance, ensuring that no one can override the group's values or seize power
- Community charters and land-use contracts will be co-written and voted upon by all founding members

**4. Fair Livelihood for Practitioners**

- We are designing this village to allow every practitioner, teacher, healer, and resident to support themselves and their family through honest, sacred work
- The sanctuary's economy will support equitable income, ethical offerings, and community sustainability — without exploitation or burnout

**5. Respect for Individual Needs, Dreams, and Safety**

- This is not a rigid commune — it is a living ecosystem designed to support individual sovereignty and personal growth within the context of the collective
- We believe in protecting each member's dreams, health, family, safety, and evolution
- You can be fully yourself — and still be held in the rhythm of the whole

## **11. Integration with Indigenous and Local Communities**

This project is committed to reciprocal, respectful, and reparative relationships with the local population.

We will:

- Offer employment opportunities
- Provide free workshops to local children and adults
- Share access to permaculture, health, and skill-based education
- Host local fundraiser events and cultural exchanges

## **12. Funding Summary**

- Greywater and solar systems
- DAO development
- Land regeneration and food forests
- Furnishing, water tanks, safety systems, initial operations
- 10% contingency buffer

All funds are nonprofit-aligned — there is no profit sharing, only reinvestment into the land, people, and purpose.
