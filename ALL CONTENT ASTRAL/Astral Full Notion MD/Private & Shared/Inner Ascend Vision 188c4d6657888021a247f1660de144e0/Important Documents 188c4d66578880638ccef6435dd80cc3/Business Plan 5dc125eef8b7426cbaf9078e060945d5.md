# Business Plan

1. **Mission**

To create a global decentralised network that fosters sustainable living, holistic education, and collaboration through a tokenised, community-driven economy. Inner Ascend empowers individuals and communities to co-create, share resources, and evolve spiritually and economically in a system that transcends traditional currencies and centralised power structures.

1. **Vision**

A world where communities operate independently yet interdependently within a decentralised, token-powered economy. A global network of eco-villages, retreat centres, and spiritual practitioners that share resources, live harmoniously with nature and support one another through innovative, regenerative systems. Inner Ascend envisions a future where people rely not on fiat currency but on their contributions, reputation, and collective wisdom to thrive in sustainable, resilient communities.

1. **Core Values**
- **Sustainability**: We are committed to ecological regeneration, reducing environmental impact, and promoting sustainable practices honouring the Earth.
- **Community**: We believe in the power of communities, where individuals come together to co-create, collaborate, and support one another in their personal and collective journeys.
- **Holistic Growth**: We prioritise the spiritual, emotional, and physical development of every individual, nurturing holistic education and experiences that foster well-being.
- **Decentralisation**: We believe in self-governance and collective decision-making, empowering communities to take charge of their destinies through transparent and decentralised systems.
- **Collaboration**: We see collaboration as the key to solving global challenges. By working together, we can create solutions that transcend borders and cultures.
- **Integrity**: We operate with transparency, honesty, and fairness in all our interactions, ensuring that every voice in the community is heard and valued.
- **Innovation**: We are always seeking new ways to evolve, both in terms of technology and community-building practices, to create a better, more inclusive world.

1. **The Problem**
- **Disconnected Communities**: Existing communities lack a cohesive, global infrastructure for sustainably sharing resources, knowledge, and governance tools.
- **Fiat Dependency**: Traditional economic models tied to fiat currency limit communities' ability to operate autonomously and embrace regenerative living.
- **Lack of Holistic Systems**: Most existing platforms and tools fail to integrate spiritual, social, and economic dimensions to support long-term personal and communal growth.
- **Centralised Power Structures**: Current economic and governance systems concentrate power in a few hands, limiting the potential for collective empowerment and fair decision-making.

1. **The Solution**

Inner Ascend DAO introduces a tokenised ecosystem that empowers global communities, practitioners, and eco-villages to connect, co-create, and thrive in a decentralised platform designed for sustainable living and collaborative governance.

- **Tokenised Economy**: Individuals and communities can earn, spend, and trade Inner Ascend tokens to access resources, services, events, and governance tools. This closed-loop economy encourages sustainable resource exchange and collaborative efforts while reducing reliance on traditional fiat currencies.
- **Decentralised Governance**: Communities and individuals actively participate in decision-making through liquid democracy and reputation-based voting. This ensures fair and equitable participation in governance, allowing members to influence resource allocation, projects, and the overall direction of the DAO.
- **Reputation-Based System**: Contributions and engagements are valued through a reputation system that rewards active participation and meaningful contributions. This system incentivises members to contribute to the community's growth while providing more significant influence in governance and access to advanced resources.
- **Holistic Incubators**: Inner Ascend's incubators are aligned with the Tzolk'in calendar and provide opportunities for learning and growth in spiritual, emotional, physical, and economic dimensions. These incubators offer courses, mentorship, and collaborative projects that help individuals and communities evolve holistically while remaining deeply connected to ancient wisdom and regenerative practices.
- **Support for Local & Global Communities**: The platform allows communities to self-govern and manage resources autonomously while benefiting from global collaboration. Through the DAO, communities can focus on regenerative living, education, and social change while maintaining their unique cultural identities. The platform bridges the local and global, enabling communities to contribute to and learn from a worldwide network of like-minded people.

1. **Strategic Objectives**
    1. **Platform Development**: Develop a user-friendly platform that integrates a **token economy**, **DAO governance**, and **community management tools**. The platform will facilitate exchanges, event hosting, resource sharing, and reputation building.
    2. **Community Building**: Partner with established communities to expand the participating **eco-villages**, **retreat centres**, and **spiritual practitioners network**. Offer them the platform to manage resources, market events, and host workshops.
    3. **Token Economy**: Establish **Inner Ascend tokens** as the primary currency for exchanging services, event access, and resources within the platform. Ensure seamless conversion between **tokens** and **fiat** when necessary, allowing participants to move between both worlds.
    4. **Incubator Growth**: Create **13 incubators** based on the Tzolk'in calendar symbols, each focused on a different aspect of holistic living (e.g., spiritual growth, creative thinking, resource management). These incubators will offer courses, mentorship, and collaborative projects to support members' personal and community development.
    5. **Member Engagement**: Encourage members to actively participate by rewarding contributions with **tokens** and **reputation points**, which can be used to unlock advanced services and governance privileges within the DAO.
