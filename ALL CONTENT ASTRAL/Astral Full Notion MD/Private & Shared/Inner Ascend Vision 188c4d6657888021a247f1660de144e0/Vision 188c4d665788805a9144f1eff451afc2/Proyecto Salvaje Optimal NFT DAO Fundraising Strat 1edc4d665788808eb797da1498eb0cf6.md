# Proyecto Salvaje: Optimal NFT/DAO Fundraising Strategy

# **Proyecto Salvaje: Optimal NFT/DAO Fundraising Strategy**

Proyecto Salvaje should run a **crypto-native crowdfunding campaign** that combines transparent on‑chain fundraising with NFT incentives and DAO governance. In practice, this means choosing a primary platform like **Juicebox or Mirror** that can handle NFT tiers, token issuance, and treasury management in one place. For example, Mirror’s crowdfund tool issues an ERC‑20 token to donors (used for Discord gating and governance) and natively supports tiered NFT rewards . Juicebox similarly lets projects mint multiple NFT tiers with defined prices and supplies (limited or open edition) as part of its funding cycle  . Both platforms have proven track records: ConstitutionDAO raised ~$40M in <7 days on Juicebox (to bid on the U.S. Constitution) , and AssangeDAO raised 17,423 ETH for WikiLeaks by combining Juicebox fundraising with a special NFT auction  . Using a single “all‑in‑one” platform simplifies the campaign – contributors donate or mint NFTs in one place – while still allowing external marketing (e.g. Mirror blog posts linking to the fund page). A purely multi‑platform approach (e.g. separate NFT mint site + Juicebox + Giveth) risks confusing donors and splitting momentum; instead, it’s often best to anchor on one crypto fundraising stack (with optional cross‑posting or matching).

## **Messaging: Land Status and Trust.**

Be crystal‑clear about **what the funds buy**. If the land is *already purchased*, emphasize that the parcel is **secured in trust** and funds will go to regenerative work (e.g. restoration, building community facilities, legal stewardship). Transparency builds trust: Juicebox-style projects highlight exactly how funds flow . If the land is *not yet acquired*, frame the campaign as a **conditional pledge** or escrow: “if we raise $X by date Y, we will buy this specific property; otherwise, refunds will be issued.” Juicebox supports this by using funding-cycle rules: for example, setting a hard target and then pausing payouts (“Payouts to None”) after the deadline allows supporters to redeem tokens for ETH if the goal is not met . This mirrors how ConstitutionDAO communicated its goal and used token redemption when the auction failed  . In short, if the property isn’t yet owned, promise transparency (show the listing, any preliminary deposits) and consider refund provisions; if it is owned, emphasize that NFT sales are closing the loop on conservation work. In either case, clear, honest wording (e.g. “Funds will purchase the 20‑acre Mazunte reserve” vs “Funds will restore our existing community land”) is critical to avoid confusion or “rug‑pull” fears.

## **NFT Tiered Sales Structure.**

Design **tiered NFTs** that align donor perks with contribution levels. Both Juicebox and Mirror let you create multiple NFT reward levels. For example, on Juicebox you can “Add NFT” with an image, description, price and supply, and repeat to make tiers . A recommended structure might be:

- **Entry-level NFT** (e.g. “Explorer Pass”): unlimited or large supply, low price (e.g. 0.1–0.5 ETH). Grants basic DAO membership and updates (and maybe a small snapshot voting weight).
- **Mid-tier NFT** (e.g. “Steward Token”): limited supply (hundreds), higher price (e.g. 1–5 ETH). Unlocks special perks like in-person visits, merch, or higher voting weight. Juicebox docs suggest using tiered NFTs for different price incentives .
- **Premium NFT** (e.g. “Caretaker Badge” or 1/1 art): very limited (maybe 10 unique pieces), high price (tens of ETH). Each could confer co-founder status, naming rights, or exclusive decision power.

These can be sold directly through the platform’s UI. For example, AssangeDAO used an *open edition* 48‑hour mint on OpenSea (29,752 editions of a “Censored” NFT) alongside a 1/1 “Clock” NFT . In practice, you might sell mid‑level tiers via Juicebox (so funds go to the DAO) and simultaneously list the highest tiers on a secondary marketplace (OpenSea or Zora) for visibility. Indeed, the Amazon League Club (a rainforest conservation NFT project) released a 3,077-piece NFT collection on OpenSea, each claiming 10 m² of rainforest, raising funds and hype  . The key is to **explain each tier** clearly (e.g. what “access” or “rights” each NFT grants, and how it ties into the sanctuary) and to link each sale to a tangible impact (e.g. “This NFT funds the planting of 100 trees in Mazunte”). Provide a simple webpage or document outlining tier benefits, and use links or QR codes in the NFT sales page to direct buyers to that info.

## **Funds Flow and Treasury.**

Route contributions into a **DAO-controlled treasury** for transparency. On Juicebox, funds are held in a smart-contract project address and distributed according to on‑chain payout rules . You can configure Juicebox so that incoming funds automatically flow into a **Gnosis Safe multi-sig wallet** (a standard DAO treasury) by adding the Safe’s address in the payouts. Using a Safe adds security and multisig control, as many DAOs do. Throughout the campaign, the Juicebox project page (or Mirror crowdfund) will display how much ETH has been raised and where it will go , which builds community trust. Once the campaign closes and funds are locked, day‑to‑day spending (hiring staff, buying land, funding restoration) can be managed via the Safe with DAO approvals.

Juicebox’s transparency is a selling point: its docs note that on‑chain treasuries let donors “see where funds will go after they contribute” . Make sure to specify any treasury splits on launch (e.g. 100% goes to purchasing land initially, then to restoration/operations later). Keep fees explicit (e.g. Juicebox takes ~5% in JBX tokens ) or consider covering them. A tip: collect funds in ETH or a stablecoin supported by the platform to avoid volatility. If using Mirror’s crowdfund, check how funds land (USDC or ETH) and how to pull them into your wallet. Ultimately, **a safe multi-sig** (like Gnosis Safe) is recommended to custody the funds, with a clear on‑chain record of withdrawals and allocations.

## **Governance Integration.**

Issuing a governance token and setting up DAO voting will align contributors long-term. Both Mirror and Juicebox campaigns can mint an ERC‑20 token: Mirror calls it a “token” for its crowdfund, while Juicebox offers a customizable JBToken. Allocate some tokens to NFT buyers (e.g. 1 token per ETH donated) or give bonus tokens to early backers. These tokens can later be used in off‑chain voting via a Snapshot space. For example, CityDAO (a land‑DAO) uses Snapshot to let “citizens” vote on land use . Likewise, you can create a Snapshot space (or use Aragon/Boardroom) so NFT holders or token holders vote on governance proposals (e.g. what to plant, community rules, how to spend treasury). Juicebox does not natively include a DAO, so the standard pattern is: post-campaign, take the list of backers and tokens and launch a Snapshot governance.

Practical tip: if using Mirror’s crowdfund, its documentation highlights that the token received by backers can gate Discord access and coordinate governance . So you could require holding a certain token balance to join the private community chat. Whatever the method, make roles and voting rules clear: e.g. “1 NFT = 1 vote, or 10 governance tokens = 1 vote.” Use existing tooling: Snapshot lets you weight votes by token or NFT holdings (even combined strategies). In short, **tokenize membership** and connect it to governance. This could be as simple as “Mirrow style tokens for voting”  or deploying a mini-DAO framework once funding closes. Ensure contributors know their stakes and rights from the start.

## **Examples & Precedents.**

Several projects have used this approach successfully.

- **ConstitutionDAO (2021):** Used Juicebox to raise >$40M quickly with an ERC‑20 token and NFT/merch incentives . Though the land (the Constitution copy) wasn’t ultimately bought, the on‑chain crowdsale proved the model. Juicebox’s transparency showed all contributions and allowed refunds after failure .
- **AssangeDAO (2022):** Combined a Juicebox campaign (17,423 ETH raised) with a Pak NFT collection. A unique 1/1 NFT (Clock) and an open-edition NFT (Censored) were minted; the latter saw 29,752 editions on OpenSea . 95% of proceeds (16,593 ETH) funded the cause . This shows the power of mixing a funding platform with a viral NFT drop.
- **CityDAO:** Tokenized a Wyoming land parcel as an NFT (Parcel 0) and used Snapshot voting for governance . New “citizenships” were sold on-chain as NFTs, granting access and vote power. Project funds (over $8M) are held in a DAO LLC’s treasury. This is analogous to a land‑DAO with clear tokenized access.
- **Amazon League Club:** A Brazilian NFT collection where each mint funds 10 m² of rainforest. They sold 3,077 NFTs on OpenSea and preserved 1,000,000 m² of land . NFT buyers got community perks (airdrops, travel contests) and conservation impact, demonstrating strong storytelling and tangible outcomes.

In summary, a **Juicebox or Mirror campaign** with tiered NFT rewards, an ERC‑20 governance token, and a multisig treasury is recommended. Be transparent about the land (owned vs. targeted) in all materials. Use tiered NFTs (via Juicebox or open editions on marketplaces) to engage donors at all levels  . Route funds into a Gnosis Safe and use Snapshot for voting  . This single, unified strategy taps proven Web3 tooling and mirrors other DAO-backed conservation efforts, giving Proyecto Salvaje the best chance to hit $1–2M and build a committed community.
