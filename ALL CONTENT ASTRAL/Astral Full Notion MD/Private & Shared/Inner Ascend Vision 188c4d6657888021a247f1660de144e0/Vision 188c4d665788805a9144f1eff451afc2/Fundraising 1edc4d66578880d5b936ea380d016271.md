# **Crypto-Native Fundraising Platforms**

**Juicebox:** An on-chain crowdfunding/treasury protocol on Ethereum. Each project is an on-chain entity (an NFT) with an owner who configures *funding cycles* (duration, payout limits, token issuance, etc.)  . Contributors send ETH (or a chosen ERC-20 base currency ) and receive “credits” that can later be converted into a project ERC-20 token . Juicebox can be linked to NFT sales via a “project payer” contract: e.g. using Thirdweb you deploy an NFT drop and set the Juicebox payer address as the sale recipient, routing mint proceeds into the Juicebox treasury .

- **NFT/Tokens:** Juicebox does *not* mint NFTs for you. You must deploy your own NFT contract (e.g. via Thirdweb or Zora) and forward funds. In return, Juicebox issues project ERC-20 tokens to supporters (and can reserve tokens for founders) .
- **Pros:** Fully transparent and programmable; proven for NFT-driven DAOs (ConstitutionDAO, Tornado DAO, SharkDAO, etc. built on Juicebox) . Supports complex tokenomics (bonding curves, reserved rates) . Funds and tokens are on-chain, easily audited. Can integrate smoothly with a Gnosis Safe treasury and Snapshot governance .
- **Cons:** Setup complexity (requires smart contract configs). Ethereum gas can be costly. Must handle NFT minting externally. Governance token issuance and management fall on project.
- **Minting Required:** Yes – you host your own NFT mint or use a drop provider. Juicebox provides the funding logic, not NFT minting.
- **Audience:** Very crypto-native (DAO/NFT communities). Juicebox is well-known in Ethereum circles for NFT and DAO launches, though not specific to climate or ReFi.

**Mirror:** A decentralized publishing platform with built-in crowdfund tools. You write a Mirror post describing the project, set a funding goal and timeframe, and backers contribute ETH. Mirror then issues each backer an ERC-20 “writing token” (membership stake) and can mint NFT rewards. Mirror **natively supports NFT tiers**: creators can define collectible NFT rewards for different pledge levels . It also has a “Patron Podium” where the top 3 contributors automatically get unique 1/1 NFTs .

- **How it works:** Mirror lets anyone with a Web3 wallet create a *Crowdfund* post. Backers send ETH and receive Mirror’s tokens (or custom Points) as proof of stake . NFTs are integrated: you can attach NFT reward tiers so that, e.g., a 0.5 ETH backer gets “Guardian” NFT, a 2 ETH backer gets “Founder” NFT, etc. . The campaign is open for a period (e.g. 7 days) or until the goal is met.
- **Pros:** **All-in-one storytelling + funding.** Great for showcasing mission/roadmap (text, images) alongside the crowdfund. Crypto natives (writers, builders) use Mirror, and the interface is user-friendly (no coding needed). NFT rewards and token gating are built-in , so you can treat your backers as community members. Campaigns are public on Mirror.xyz and easily shareable.
- **Cons:** Still primarily crypto audiences (writers, artists), not mainstream. Only accepts crypto (ETH or Polygon). Campaigns run one-shot (no continuous cycles). No built-in stablecoin option (mostly ETH). Governance token (Mirrors’ own token) exists but separate; not a DAO by itself.
- **Minting Required:** No separate mint needed for Mirror’s built-in NFTs. You use Mirror’s interface to upload artworks and reward levels.
- **Audience:** Crypto-smart creators and supporters. Mirror is well-known in Web3 publishing and NFT circles, but niche outside tech-savvy donors.

**Gitcoin Grants:** A quadratic-funding donation platform. Projects apply for a *Grants Round* (open or themed rounds). Donors contribute ETH or USDC to approved projects during the round; an algorithm matches funds based on the number of donors . This makes grassroots support (many small donors) especially valuable.

- **How it works:** A Gitcoin round is time-limited. Donors pick your project and give crypto; funds (including match from sponsors) go directly to your wallet. No tokens are issued — it’s pure funding.
- **Pros:** Proven for public goods – has funded $50M+ in open-source and climate projects . Matching can greatly amplify small contributions. The Gitcoin community is highly crypto-native and motivated by impact. The platform is well-known (strong brand in crypto philanthropy).
- **Cons:** Focus on open-source/Web3 public goods ; if Salvaje is not classified there, it may be in an “other” category. Only active during grant rounds (not continuous fundraising). Application review is competitive and project must fit round criteria. No NFT or membership features – just straight donation.
- **Minting Required:** No. You just provide a project description and accept donations.
- **Audience:** Tech and crypto-focused donors, open-source advocates. Very crypto-native; not broad mass-market. Aligned with ReFi/public-good ethos (especially in climate-themed rounds).

**Giveth:** A crypto donation portal for social good (often pitched as ReFi-aligned). On Giveth you create a *project page*, and donors send crypto (ETH, USDC, DAI, etc.) directly to you with **zero platform fees** . Giveth emphasizes transparency: 100% of contributions go to the project (tracked on-chain) .

- **How it works:** Create a project (with description, milestones). Donors click “Donate” and choose a crypto. Funds flow to your wallet/Gnosis Safe immediately. Giveth then tracks donations on your project page. There is an optional *verification* process: “Verified” projects can activate **GIVbacks** – donors get GIV token rewards (like cashback) for giving . Giveth has also run quadratic funding rounds of its own.
- **Pros:** Very donor-friendly (simple UI, many coin options, no fees ). Highly transparent (on-chain ledger of donations). Focus on impact projects; strong community ethos. GIVbacks/GIVpower add gamification and donor incentives. Continuous funding (not tied to rounds) means donors can give anytime.
- **Cons:** Rewards (GIVbacks) are limited to *verified* projects , so new projects face onboarding. No native NFT or token issuance; purely donations. Lacks a built-in governance mechanism. Audience is crypto-native but more specialized toward philanthropists, social impact, and ReFi circles. Not primarily targeting Web3 builders.
- **Minting Required:** No NFT minting. Only set up your project page. Donors give directly.
- **Audience:** Crypto-savvy donors interested in charity and public goods. Overlaps with ReFi networks and DAOs focused on social/environmental impact.

**Hypercerts:** An emerging protocol for funding impact. Projects define **impact NFTs** (ERC-1155) that certify pieces of work (who did it, what scope, when) and are *fractionalized*. Funders can “buy a share” of the impact by purchasing portions of these hypercert tokens  . Each hypercert has detailed metadata and third-party evaluations to prove real-world impact.

- **How it works:** A project creates a hypercert describing some deliverable (e.g. “Planted 10,000 trees in 2024”). The hypercert is an NFT with a set supply. Donors buy parts of it for funding; they receive semi-fungible tokens representing a share of that impact . The system aims to reward work based on measured results rather than promises .
- **Pros:** High transparency and impact tracking (good for environmental projects). Blends charitable giving with token ownership; donors “own” a share of the public good. It’s a Web3-native way to certify contributions.
- **Cons:** Very new and niche. Requires users to understand a complex model. No large user base or straightforward campaign UI yet (funding is mostly conceptual/prototype stage). Not designed for simple one-time fundraising — it’s more for allocating grants based on outcomes.
- **Minting Required:** Projects must mint hypercert NFTs (currently via the Hypercerts app) – it’s not out-of-the-box like a donation form.
- **Audience:** Cutting-edge ReFi and DAO communities, public-goods funders. Highly crypto-savvy, trust-oriented users. Not a mass platform yet, more of a protocol/standard.

**Other Platforms:** For completeness, note **The Giving Block** – a major crypto-fundraising platform for charities . It’s oriented to non-profits (especially in the US, with tax-advantaged donations) and supports dozens of cryptocurrencies. It provides donation pages and campaigns 24/7. It **does not** issue tokens or NFTs, nor does it involve quadratic matching or DAO governance  . Use it if you register as a nonprofit and want to tap high-value crypto donors (e.g. via credit card or crypto). It’s broad but not specifically “crypto-native” or ReFi-focused.

## **Examples of Regenerative/NFT Fundraising Projects**

- **Smart Village (BC, Canada):** Future Thinkers launched a 10,000 SEED Token NFT drop to fund their regenerative living lab. Each SEED NFT is a membership card, collectible artwork and even plants a real tree in donors’ names . They offered tiered editions (Seed, Bronze, Silver, Gold) for different pledge amounts . This directly parallels Proyecto Salvaje’s NFT-tier idea.
- **Happy Goat (California):** A “Web3 nonprofit” sold 4,242 goat-themed NFTs at ~0.086 ETH each. NFT holders get DAO membership and access to an 1850‑acre regenerative farm and studio . This shows the power of NFT passes with on-chain access and governance for a community project.
- **Vida Verde (Venezuela):** A grassroots agroforestry project raised ~$3.9k from 70 contributors on Giveth . They accepted crypto donations via Giveth’s public portal, leveraging its transparency and community reach.
- **Mirror Crowdfunds:** Projects on Mirror (e.g. art labs, DAOs) have raised significant ETH by issuing NFTs and tokens to backers . For instance, Mirror’s $CABIN and $PARTY campaigns offered NFT rewards to fund creative/ecosystem endeavors. (While not all were environmental, the mechanism – crowdfund+NFT rewards – fits Salvaje’s needs.)

## **Recommended Fundraising Structure**

- **Tiered NFT Sale:** Offer a limited number of high-tier “Founders/Guardian” NFTs with generous perks (on-site access, major governance rights, physical benefits). Deploy these via an NFT drop (e.g. Thirdweb or a Mirror campaign) so proceeds go straight to the DAO treasury. *Example:* Future Thinkers sold their limited SEED/Bronze/Silver NFTs to fund land purchase and tree planting . Similarly, Happy Goat sold its premium NFTs for farm access .
- **Broad Community Campaign:** Run a public crowdfund (e.g. on Mirror or via Juicebox) with multiple tiers. Mirror allows you to set NFT reward tiers for ETH donations , while Juicebox can accept both ETH and stablecoins and issue a project ERC-20 (so donors get a token stake). Use this to capture mid-level supporters who may not afford the top NFTs but still want membership tokens or smaller collectible NFTs.
- **Open Donations:** Maintain an ongoing donation page (e.g. on Giveth) and apply to Gitcoin Grants rounds. This captures smaller crypto contributions. Giveth’s zero-fee, transparent model is ideal for continuous giving . Gitcoin rounds (especially if there’s a climate/commons category) can multiply funds via matching .
- **Governance & Treasury:** Hold all funds in a **Gnosis Safe** multi-sig for security and transparency. Set up a **Snapshot** space for community voting. (Juicebox explicitly integrates with Gnosis Safe + Snapshot .) Use the NFTs and/or ERC-20 tokens as voting power. For example, you might set it so each Guardian NFT = 100 votes, Founders = 50, and community tokens or SEED NFTs = 1. You can even use SafeSnap to have proposals executed directly from Snapshot.
- **Balancing Tiers:** Only mint a few very expensive NFTs (e.g. <20 Gold Founders) with unique perks, then more medium-priced NFTs (Guardians), and a larger pool of inexpensive “Friends” tokens or NFTs. This ensures both major backers and casual supporters can join. Offer “thank-you” tokens or Hypercerts to micro-donors. Provide some on-chain recognition to all (even a free/low-cost NFT or token badge). The goal is a tiered spectrum: large donors get rich perks, smaller donors get community access.

This hybrid model—exclusive NFT tiers *plus* an open donation drive—leverages crypto tools and keeps community involved. For example, sell NFTs on your site or a platform (funds → Safe), run a Mirror/Juicebox campaign to issue membership tokens  , and collect donations via Giveth/Gitcoin. Throughout, use Snapshot (SafeSnap) so all token or NFT holders have voting rights . Such an approach balances high-value fundraising with broad participation, aligning perfectly with Salvaje’s DAO and ReFi goals.
