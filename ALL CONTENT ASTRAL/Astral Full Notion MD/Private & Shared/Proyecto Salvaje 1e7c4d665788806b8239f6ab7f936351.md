# Proyecto Salvaje

# Regenerative Sanctuary – Project Overview

# **1. The Core Vision**

We are creating an intentional regenerative community — a healing village, a real-life school, and an educational center — dedicated to protecting human integrity and sovereign birthrights: freedom, bodily autonomy, spiritual self-determination, and the right to live in harmony with nature.

This is a regenerative, heart-led social project designed for the times we are living through now: a world in collapse, disillusioned with power structures, and hungry for rooted alternatives. This sanctuary is not a wellness product or spiritual retreat — it is a shelter, a school, a resistance space, and a seed for a new world.

# **2. Why This Sanctuary Is Necessary Now**

We are stepping out of the over-capitalization of the wellness industry by prioritizing community-driven growth, equitable access, and mutual support over profit. We are witnessing the fall of new-age spirituality and the collapse of hollow spiritual consumerism.

We are looking for a third way — one focused on the human factor: on how to heal, support, and stand with each other in reciprocity with the Earth.

This sanctuary exists to:

- Resist dehumanization
- Shelter those defending truth and dignity
- Reclaim the original instructions on how to live in community and equilibrium
- Redefine togetherness, sovereignty, and service

# **3. Programs and Offerings**

We are not offering escape — we are offering transformation through embodied living. Our programs include:

Educational Curriculums:

- Natural building, permaculture, sustainable energy
- Nutrition, health, somatics, nervous system education
- Emotional intelligence, family systems, tending the self
- Communication, relational skill-building
- Relationship with the sacred, animism, integration
- Elemental and ceremonial work

Transformational Experiences:

- Youth vision quests and rites of passage
- Children’s mystery school
- Whole family rewilding gatherings
- Cross-pollination gatherings for aligned projects
- Vision-to-action incubators
- Inner alchemy journeys

Healing Modalities Practiced:

- Sacred medicine ceremonies (with integrity and safety)
- Expressive arts and storytelling
- Breathwork and somatic therapy
- Energetic and ancestral healing
- Talking therapy & integration circles
- Rituals, constellations, and Gestalt

**4. The Land**

The project is being birthed in Oaxaca, Mexico, a country carrying a powerful lineage of indigenous rights, cultural resistance, and ancestral knowledge. Our 12-acre land lies on the Pacific coast near Mazunte, a region already rich in collective initiatives, land regeneration, and holistic practices.

- Bordered by natural reserve, lagoon, and mangroves
- Old-growth trees, flat and hilly areas, perfect for permaculture
- Access to water, electricity, and private road
- Zoned for 20 eco-homes and capacity for ~40 residents
- One hour from international airport, connected by highway

**5. Legal Framework and Governance**

The project will be established as a Mexican non-profit organization (ONG) with an integrated DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) providing transparent governance.

- Full transparency of resource flow and decision-making
- DAO onboarding via interviews and values-based voting
- Residents and digital members must align with founding values
- Yearly contribution from land residents covers shared costs
- External DAO members can support, govern, and co-create from anywhere in the world

**6. Integration with Indigenous and Local Communities**

This project is committed to reciprocal, respectful, and reparative relationships with the local population.

We will:

- Offer employment opportunities
- Provide free workshops to local children and adults
- Share access to permaculture, health, and skill-based education
- Host local fundraiser events and cultural exchanges

**7. Funding Goals**

We are currently raising $1.25 million USD to build the full sanctuary. This includes:

- Eco-infrastructure (cabins, communal spaces, kitchens, temples)
- Greywater and solar systems
- DAO development
- Land regeneration and food forests
- Furnishing, water tanks, safety systems, initial operations
- 10% contingency buffer

All funds are nonprofit-aligned — there is no profit sharing, only reinvestment into the land, people, and purpose.

**8. Founding Members & Land Stewardship Model**

We are now calling in a circle of Founding Members — the humans who will root, hold, and protect this sanctuary as it comes to life.

Founding Members are not just donors or early residents — they are guardians of the vision, committed to living in alignment with the values of regeneration, sovereignty, integrity, and emotional truth. They are those who will co-create the cultural DNA, hold responsibility, and tend the land as a living being.

This circle includes two essential strands:

- Those who have been with the project from the beginning, often with lower income but deep presence — contributing time, vision, and early financial offerings to secure the land itself.
- Those who are  arriving to co-hold the project, bringing in larger capital, skills, and structure to help build and stabilize the sanctuary for the long term.

To ensure true commitment and protect the collective, all founding stewards will contribute in some form — whether through financial capital, land security, sweat equity, or long-term presence.

Some members who have contributed early funds to secure the land will receive ownership or long-term use rights accordingly — through clear ethical agreements that preserve the land’s purpose. Others entering later may purchase land use rights and help fund the eco-infrastructure, systems, and structures.

Land is never for speculative resale, but it may be personally inhabited, cultivated, and tended. Each founding steward may build a home, co-create shared spaces, and take root — with alignment to shared guidelines and sacred trust agreements.

Contribution Model:

Path | Role | Contribution | Rights & Participation

| **Path** | **Role** | **Contribution** | **Rights & Participation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Early Founders | Already involved in land or vision | Contribution already made (land security, vision, roots) | Land use and/or ownership rights based on prior investment; equal voice in DAO |
| Anchor Stewards | Full-time residents | $100,000–$150,000 USD | Private land plot, home-building rights, DAO membership, lifetime residency |
| Core Contributors | Part-time or shared housing | $50,000–$75,000 USD | Shared eco-home, co-creation roles, DAO access, seasonal stay |
| Vision Allies | Off-site support circle | $10,000–$25,000 USD | Governance voice, ceremonial recognition, lifetime access and invitations |

All contributions are non-refundable and are considered a sacred investment into the Earth, the future, and the sanctuary’s purpose.

Agreements are structured through the Mexican NGO and DAO, ensuring legal clarity and transparent governance while protecting the land from commodification.

Becoming a Founding Member:

Each path begins with:

- A values-based dialogue and interview
- Agreement on land use, contribution, and culture
- Participation in DAO governance
- Optional on-site immersion or orientation for residency roles

**9. Ethical Legal Structure & Protection for All Stewards**

We are building a legal structure that not only governs the sanctuary — it protects everyone who contributes to it. Whether your investment is monetary, energetic, or time-based, this community will be structured to honor and safeguard your offering.

This is not just a legal framework — it is a soul agreement in practical form.

We are ensuring:

**1. Equity of Contribution**

- Those who contribute early energy, land work, and presence are recognized and protected
- Those who contribute funds receive clear agreements, transparent ownership, and full DAO access
- Every steward, regardless of wealth, has a voice and a role in the sanctuary’s future

**2. Rightful Ownership of Homes & Land**

- Anyone who contributes toward land and construction costs will legally own their plot and eco-home through clear contracts held by the NGO or a trust structure
- There will be no speculative real estate — only rooted, life-aligned, shared ownership governed by sacred agreements

**3. Legal Protection for All Members**

- All agreements will be backed by a Mexican nonprofit and DAO-enabled governance, ensuring that no one can override the group’s values or seize power
- Community charters and land-use contracts will be co-written and voted upon by all founding members

**4. Fair Livelihood for Practitioners**

- We are designing this village to allow every practitioner, teacher, healer, and resident to support themselves and their family through honest, sacred work
- The sanctuary’s economy will support equitable income, ethical offerings, and community sustainability — without exploitation or burnout

**5. Respect for Individual Needs, Dreams, and Safety**

- This is not a rigid commune — it is a living ecosystem designed to support individual sovereignty and personal growth within the context of the collective
- We believe in protecting each member’s dreams, health, family, safety, and evolution
- You can be fully yourself — and still be held in the rhythm of the whole

# **A. REGENERATIVE REFUGE: FULL BUSINESS PLAN OUTLINE (ReFi + DAO Ready)**

**1. Executive Summary (1 page)**

Purpose:

This is the first thing investors read. It must summarize everything clearly, emotionally and logically. We are aiming to get founding from ReFi investors (regenerative finances- Blockchain - Cryptocurrency)

Answer these questions:

- What is the name of your project? (ex: Proyecto Salvaje, Inner Ascend Retreat, etc.)

**PROYECTO SALVAJE - INNER ASCEND DAO** 

- In one sentence, what is your mission?

**We are creating a regenerative village and living school dedicated to restoring human dignity, sovereignty, and sacred relationship with the Earth through community, education, healing, and embodied remembrance**

- Where is your land located? (country, ecosystem type, size in hectares/acres)

**Our land is located on the Pacific coast of Oaxaca, Mexico, where the Sierra Madre mountains meet the ocean.**

**It is part of a rich ecological corridor, neighboring natural reserves, mangroves, and lagoon systems.**

**The land covers approximately 12 acres (about 5 hectares) of fertile soil, with access to natural water sources, lush vegetation, and a diversity of native trees.**

**It is nestled in a rural agricultural zone near the town of Mazunte, offering both seclusion for deep regenerative work and connection to an already vibrant community of healers, visionaries, and land stewards**

- What exactly are you creating? (retreat center, regenerative academy, healing sanctuary?)

**We are establishing an intentional, regenerative community in Oaxaca, Mexico — a sanctuary that integrates a healing village, a living school, and an educational center. This space is dedicated to protecting human integrity and sovereign birthrights: freedom, bodily autonomy, spiritual self-determination, and the right to live in harmony with nature. Our aim is to provide an immersive environment where individuals and families can engage in transformative practices, learn sustainable living skills, and participate in communal healing, all while fostering a deep connection with the Earth.**

- How are you different? (what makes your project sacred, necessary, and powerful?)

**Unlike typical retreat centers or new-age communities, we are building a regenerative sanctuary that defends human sovereignty, tends collective trauma, reclaims sacred living through decolonized, community-led resilience — and stands as a living school to educate, empower, and preserve the essence of humanity beyond profit-driven wellness.**

- How much funding are you raising? (amount in USD or crypto equivalent)

**First round 700 K second round 1 M**

- What will the funding be used for? (e.g., land restoration, facilities, DAO development, marketing)

    - Who is your ideal customer? (age, values, profession, lifestyle)
- What competitors exist? How are you different or better?
- How big is your potential market? (ex: Wellness tourism is a $919B industry by 2030)

Tips:

- You need to show that this is not a “nice idea” — it’s part of a rising global trend.

**Global Trends Supporting Our Sanctuary**

The sanctuary  is a strategic, essential, and inevitable response to intersecting global crises.

Our project aligns with several powerful and rising movements

| **Trend** | **What It Means** |
| --- | --- |
| Global Collapse & Systemic Distrust | People are losing trust in governments, institutions, and the dominant system. They are seeking sovereign, off-grid, emotionally grounded communities. |
| Rise of Regenerative Living | People are no longer satisfied with sustainability — they want regeneration: healing land, culture, and spirit. |
| Explosive Growth of Eco-Tourism & Wellness Travel | The wellness tourism industry is projected to reach $919B by 2030. People are traveling to find meaning, healing, and community. |
| Decentralized Living & Web3 Culture | The ReFi (Regenerative Finance), crypto, and DAO movements are creating real-life experiments in post-capitalist cooperation and decentralized governance. |
| Mental Health & Somatic Healing Explosion | There is a tidal wave of demand for trauma-informed spaces, nervous system education, emotional healing, and sacred medicine integration. |
| Post-Spiritual Consumer Awakening | People are leaving new-age capitalism, bypass culture, and spiritual commodification in search of real, earth-rooted, decolonized spiritual connection. |

**Why This Sanctuary is Not Just Wanted — It’s Necessary**

In a collapsing world, spaces like this become essential infrastructure for human survival and reorientation.

We are not selling retreats — we are offering a shelter, a re-skilling center, a resistance camp for the soul.

This sanctuary will serve as:

- A gathering ground for awakened humans seeking to live differently
- A shelter from toxic cities, coercive systems, and spiritual despair
- A training ground for post-collapse living, emotional resilience, and regenerative culture
- A space of remembrance — where indigenous wisdom, earth connection, and communal truth are kept alive

**Our Ideal audience**

| **Profile** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| Age Range | 25–55 (millennials, early Gen X, younger Gen Z emerging) |
| Profession | Conscious entrepreneurs, holistic practitioners, healers, artists, activists, tech-for-good builders, facilitators, cultural creatives |
| Values | Freedom, regeneration, truth, sacred integrity, emotional honesty, justice, sovereignty |
| Lifestyle | Nomadic, nature-seeking, post-capitalist, digital-native, community-curious, deeply sensitive and awake to the world’s pain |
| Pain Point | Disillusionment with modern life. Burnout. Disconnection. Isolation. Political betrayal. Longing for tribe, land, spirit, and purpose. |

**How Big is Our Market?**

| **Industry** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| Wellness Tourism | $919 Billion by 2030 (Global Wellness Institute) |
| Eco-Tourism | $333 Billion by 2027 (Allied Market Research) |
| Regenerative Travel | >30% annual growth as travelers shift from luxury to meaning |
| Web3 & ReFi Aligned Capital | Hundreds of DAOs and investors now funding regenerative land, education, and culture |
| Spiritual Healing & Psychedelic Integration | Multi-billion market, growing exponentially post-COVID and due to mental health crisis |

**6. DAO and Governance Model**

Purpose:

Explain how decentralization and community ownership empower your project.

Answer these questions:

- What parts of the project are privately owned? (example: the land)
- What parts are DAO-governed? (example: programming, impact projects, scholarship funds)
- Who can join the DAO? (anyone, only retreat alumni, token holders?)
- What decisions will DAO members vote on?
- What is the governance process? (token-weighted voting? one-person one-vote?)
- How do you ensure the DAO remains mission-aligned?

Tips:

- Investors want to know that your DAO is empowering but not chaotic.

**7. Tokenomics and ReFi Integration**

Purpose:

Show how your regenerative economy works.

Answer these questions:

- What tokens are you creating? (ex: Steward Tokens, Guardian NFTs)
- What is the total supply? (fixed or inflationary?)
- How will tokens be used? (retreat access, voting rights, staking rewards for regeneration?)
- How are tokens distributed? (founders %, investors %, public sale %, community rewards %)
- How does value grow over time? (regeneration success = token appreciation?)

Tips:

- Focus on real regenerative value, not hype.

**8. Financial Projections (3 years)**

Purpose:

Prove you can be financially sustainable.

Answer these questions:

- What are your projected revenues for Year 1, 2, and 3? (be specific by revenue stream)
- What are your major expenses? (land maintenance, staff, marketing, legal, infrastructure)
- When do you expect to reach breakeven? (typically end of Year 2 for these projects)
- What is your projected net profit by Year 3?
- How much will token appreciation or ReFi rewards add?

Tips:

- Always show conservative, realistic, and best-case versions.

**9. Funding Request and Use of Funds**
