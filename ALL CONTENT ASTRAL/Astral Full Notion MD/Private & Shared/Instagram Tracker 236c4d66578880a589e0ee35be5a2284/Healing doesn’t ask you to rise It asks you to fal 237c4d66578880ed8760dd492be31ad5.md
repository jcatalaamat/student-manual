Healing doesn’t ask you to rise. It asks you to fall without defense.”

—

Stop trying to be strong.

Stop trying to explain.

Stop trying to grow through it.

Some things don’t want your insight.

They want your collapse.

They want the cracking.

The gasp.

The moment your palms hit the floor

and you let yourself lose.

That’s when the healing begins.

When the war ends.

Not in understanding —

but in surrender.

—

So if you’re down there,

trembling in the mess,

not sure if you’re doing it right —

you are.
