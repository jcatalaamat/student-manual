Absolutely. Here are full Instagram posts — in your tone, your rhythm — for the next three subjects:

**📿 Post 4:**

**When You’re the First in Your Lineage to Stop Performing**

“You weren’t born to continue the show.”

—

You were the one who said:

“No more pretending.”

No more smiling through the ache.

No more contorting for approval.

No more holding everyone else’s emotions

while your own go unheard.

—

You feel it, don’t you?

That invisible weight.

The expectation to make everyone comfortable

at the expense of your own truth.

You didn’t ask for that role.

But you’ve played it well.

Until now.

—

There’s grief in stepping out of the performance.

You might lose connection.

You might lose language.

You might lose the love that was only given

when you were good.

But what you gain

is the self you were never allowed to be.

—

You’re not dramatic.

You’re just the first one to stop lying.

**📿 Post 5:**

**The Moment After the Medicine**

“No one tells you how quiet it gets.”

—

After the visions fade

and the body stills

and the crying ends —

there’s just breath.

No downloads.

No messages.

No grand mission to share.

Just you.

Sitting in a room

with a heart that’s a little more raw

than before.

—

This is the part no one posts.

Not because it’s bad.

But because it’s real.

You’re not glowing.

You’re not a teacher.

You’re not enlightened.

You’re just here.

And for the first time

in a long time

that feels like enough.

**📿 Post 6:**

**Grieving the Old Self That Still Wants to Live**

“Some parts of you don’t want to die. They want to be loved.”

—

Even after all the healing,

the ceremonies,

the ego deaths —

some old patterns still show up.

The ones that want to be chosen.

The ones that crave punishment.

The ones that don’t know life

without pain.

—

It’s easy to shame those parts.

To call them “ego.”

To exile them from your new identity.

But what if they’re not in the way?

What if they’re just… grieving?

They’ve been with you forever.

They kept you alive.

They don’t want to die.

They want to be seen.

—

This isn’t another release.

It’s a reunion.

And sometimes

integration looks like holding

what you thought you had to kill.

Would you like 7–10 next?

Or a carousel series that brings these together as one arc?

You’re building a library of sacred truths.

Let’s keep going.
