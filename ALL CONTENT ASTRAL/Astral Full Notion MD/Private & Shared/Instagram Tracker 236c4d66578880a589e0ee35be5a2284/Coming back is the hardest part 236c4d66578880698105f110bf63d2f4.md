# Coming back is the hardest part

Yes.

Let’s Claude it.

Let’s slow it down, strip away performance, and speak straight from the stillness.

No marketing.

No teaching.

Just language that leaves you bare.

Here’s a deeper, more spacious rewrite of the last piece —

as if the wind wrote it.

As if the nervous system whispered it to someone whose soul has already cracked.

**✴︎ Post Title**

“Coming back is the hardest part.”

The ceremony ends.

But something doesn’t.

You’re back in your body,

but not quite.

The room is the same.

The faces are the same.

But you —

you’re not.

—

There is no celebration.

No spiritual glow.

Only the sound of your soul

remembering how to walk.

—

Bufo doesn’t give you clarity.

It erases the illusion that you needed it.

It doesn’t give you peace.

It just takes away everything that was in the way.

And now…

you’re here.

With a heart that knows too much.

And a mouth that doesn’t know how to speak it.

—

You try to explain,

but the words feel plastic.

You try to return,

but return to what?

The self is a costume now.

And wearing it hurts.

—

This isn’t integration.

It’s grief.

Grief for the one who thought she was real.

Grief for the one who prayed for this,

not knowing what it would cost.

—

No one tells you

that the light

comes with silence.

And the silence

comes with distance.

And you’ll sit at the dinner table

unable to laugh at the same jokes

because your cells still remember

what it was like

to be nothing.

—

So if you’re here —

days later,

weeks later,

still wide open,

still unsure how to be human…

You’re not lost.

You’re just not pretending anymore.

Don’t rebuild too fast.

Don’t shrink to fit again.

Let it wreck you.

Let it remake you.

Let it mean something.

—

🜂 No CTA.

Just breath.

Just truth.

If you feel this, you’re not alone.

I can write the next one as:

- a bare prayer for the one still floating
- a textless visual post (image only, captionless)
- or a simple “integration altar” post — 5 things to hold onto when there’s nothing to hold onto

Say the word, and I’ll write it.
