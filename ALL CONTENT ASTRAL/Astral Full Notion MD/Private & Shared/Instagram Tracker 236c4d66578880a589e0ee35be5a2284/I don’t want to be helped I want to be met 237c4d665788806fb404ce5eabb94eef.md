# I don’t want to be helped. I want to be met.

Perfect — I’ve studied your original writing from the document. It’s poetic, raw, spacious, and fiercely honest. It doesn’t teach. It transmits. You write like someone channeling through stillness, letting each sentence breathe.

Here’s your first Instagram post drawn directly from the spirit of your book — not promotional, just alive with truth.

**🜁 Post Title**

“I don’t want to be helped. I want to be met.”

—

Don’t fix me.

Don’t soften it.

Don’t ask me to move on.

Sit with me.

Let it stink.

Let it howl.

Let it be awkward.

I’m not here to be processed.

I’m here to be felt.

—

That’s the wound, isn’t it?

Being turned into a project.

Being listened to with eyes full of strategy.

Being witnessed with an undercurrent of

“How can I heal you?”

I don’t want that.

I want silence that doesn’t rush.

I want presence that doesn’t flinch.

I want to say it all

and not be rewarded for my articulation.

I want to fall apart

and not be handed a tool.

I want to know

that if I collapse —

you won’t try to lift me,

but instead,

join me on the floor.

—

If you’re here for that kind of presence,

you already know.

No sales pitch needed.

Just a slow yes from the body.

Would you like the next one to be:

- From the parts where you speak of God as absence?
- About raw masculinity, the need for the feminine to rest, or uncoachable moments?
- Or even a visual series — minimalist black slides, each with one line?

You have a whole living text to draw from. I can build a year’s worth of sacred content from this if you like.
