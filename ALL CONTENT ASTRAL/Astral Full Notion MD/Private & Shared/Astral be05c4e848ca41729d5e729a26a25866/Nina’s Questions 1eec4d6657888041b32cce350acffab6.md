# Nina’s Questions

## **6. DAO and Governance Model**

### **Purpose:**

Decentralization ensures that the community co-creates and protects the long-term vision of Proyecto Salvaje as a sacred, regenerative sanctuary—not just a retreat or business. The DAO is both a governance body and a cultural guardian.

---

### **🔐**

### **Ownership Breakdown**

- **Privately Owned:**
    - The land is held via a **nonprofit trust or stewardship entity** in Mexico, with initial title secured by core founders or founding stewards.
    - Early land acquisition is *not* DAO-governed but is later integrated into the DAO’s influence through sacred agreements and long-term access rights.
- **DAO-Governed:**
    - Programming, events, retreats, scholarship funds, governance rules, access policies, seasonal calendars, and ceremonial codes.
    - All NFT-based stay rights and upgrades
    - Treasury allocations for infrastructure, salaries, education, and social impact.

---

### **🧑‍🤝‍🧑**

### **Who Can Join the DAO?**

- **Token/NFT holders only** can join (starting with Founding Stewards and Builders)
- Each holder undergoes a **values-based onboarding process** before activation
- Seasonal guests have limited voting rights
- Digital-only members may participate in soft governance (polls, cultural input)

---

### **🗳️**

### **Voting Topics**

- Treasury allocation and budgeting
- New residency or long-term member approval
- Infrastructure priorities (build next: family house or temple?)
- Retreat pricing or seasonal calendars
- Cultural or ceremonial guidelines
- Conflict resolution or steward rotation

---

### **⚖️**

### **Governance Process**

- Voting is **token-weighted by NFT tier** (e.g., Stewards = 3 votes, Builders = 2, Guests = 1)
- Core “Sacred” decisions (e.g., land repurposing, new villages) require:
    - 66%+ quorum
    - Approval from Founding Council
    - DAO-wide reflection or ceremonial ratification
- All votes are held via **Snapshot or Tally**, with results transparently published

---

### **🛡️**

### **Alignment + Safeguards**

- Founders retain **mission-anchoring veto** on sacred charter violations
- Proposals require context: budget, values alignment, and impact
- Onboarding includes explicit **soul agreement** with values, not just tech
- Roles and domain teams rotate to prevent stagnation or capture
- Community feedback loops integrated seasonally

---

## **7. Tokenomics and ReFi Integration**

### **Purpose:**

To align regenerative action with meaningful participation, NFTs and (optionally) ERC-20 utility tokens will reflect access, contribution, and cultural weight—not profit speculation.

---

### **💠**

### **Tokens Being Created**

- **NFTs**:
    - Guardian NFTs (Digital participation)
    - Guest / Builder / Steward NFTs (Access + governance)
- **Optional Utility Token** (e.g., $ASCEND):
    - Used internally for upgrades, proposal deposits, recognition, and access bonuses
    - Not a speculative currency but a **community utility tool**

---

### **📦**

### **Token Supply**

- **NFTs**: Fixed per tier and release (phased minting: e.g., 100 Stewards max, 300 Guests/year)
- **Utility Token**: Semi-fixed capped supply (e.g., 1M $ASCEND with gradual unlocking)

---

### **🧭**

### **Token Uses**

- Retreat discounts + priority booking
- Weighted voting power
- Stake for proposal rights or infrastructure votes
- Access gated events or resources
- Gift or transfer regenerative credits to others
- Earn from verified land work (future: Regen registry, Gitcoin + Allo)

---

### **🎯**

### **Token Distribution**

- 10% — Founding team + initial builders
- 15% — DAO treasury (grants, emergency, funding future sanctuaries)
- 30% — Early contributors (NFT-based access mints)
- 20% — Ecosystem/partnerships (Gitcoin, ReFi, land networks)
- 25% — Long-term incentives (regeneration rewards, role-based badges)

---

### **🌱**

### **How Value Grows**

- Tokens are **not designed for financial speculation**, but for cultural and regenerative participation
- Value increases as:\n
    - The sanctuary expands and infrastructure grows
    - More DAO members join and use the system
    - Impact data (trees planted, ceremonies held, scholarships funded) is publicly verified
    - Secondary partners (Gitcoin, ReFi DAOs) amplify token relevance through grants or staking
