The Dark Side of Spiritual Bypassing in Integration Work,Anti-Spiritual,Drop a comment about a 'spiritual bypass' you've experienced or witnessed. Let's get real about this together. Or DM me if you're struggling with integration that honors ALL parts of your experience.,"Ever noticed how 'spiritual bypassing' shows up in psychedelic integration? Here's the thing: true healing isn't about skipping to the good vibes. It's about sitting with the uncomfortable stuff too.

In my integration practice, I often see clients who've been told to ""just focus on the light"" after intense medicine experiences. But here's what gets missed: those difficult emotions are INFORMATION. They're not obstacles to your healing—they ARE the healing.

The shadow work IS the work. And honestly? I'd rather help you move through your darkness with honesty than paint sparkles on your pain.

Dark background with one light source.",,"The concept of spiritual bypassing, where individuals avoid difficult emotions in favor of maintaining a positive spiritual outlook, can hinder genuine healing and integration. It is essential to recognize and process painful experiences rather than dismiss them in pursuit of ""good vibes."" This approach can lead to deeper understanding and growth, allowing individuals to address the full spectrum of their emotional experiences. Engaging with the shadow aspects of one's journey is crucial for authentic integration and healing."

Three Questions I Ask Before Every Bufo Ceremony,Method Creator,"If you're considering working with Bufo/5-MeO-DMT, save this post. And if you've worked with it before, what pre-ceremony question would you add?","Before ANY Bufo ceremony, I have my clients answer these three questions. They've changed everything about how my clients integrate their experiences:

1. ""What are you willing to let die today?"" (Not metaphorically. What part of your identity are you ready to release?)

2. ""If this medicine gives you nothing but difficult truths, are you prepared to receive them?""

3. ""Who will you be if your biggest belief systems are challenged?""

Pre-ceremony preparation isn't about getting 'good vibes' - it's about preparing for transformation. And transformation isn't always comfortable.

What question would you add to this list?",8,Method Explanation,"June 25, 2025",#bufoalvarius #5meodmt #psychedelicintegration #medicinepreparation #psychedelichealing #ceremonyprep #transformationalhealing,The three questions I ask before Bufo that completely transformed my client outcomes (hint: none of them are about 'setting intentions'),"Developed these questions over 5+ years of ceremony work, refined based on client feedback about what helped them most",Could be expanded into a longer-form post or guide about pre-ceremony preparation.

Why I Fired a Client (And Why It's the Most Ethical Thing I've Ever Done),Honest Healing,"If you're considering working with plant medicines or Bufo, make sure your facilitator is willing to say no when necessary. It's one of the best signs of integrity you can find.","Last month, I turned away a high-paying client seeking Bufo facilitation.

He had the money. He had the time. He'd done his research. But something felt off in our initial consultation.

When I asked about his motivation, he said: ""I want to experience ego death because I've heard it's the ultimate high.""

I probed deeper about integration support, his mental health history, and preparation. His answers revealed he was treating this like a bucket list item rather than a profound healing journey.

So I said no. And recommended therapy first.

Was it an easy decision? No. That money would have been nice.

But here's what I believe: Medicine work isn't for everyone at every time. Sometimes the most ethical thing we can do as practitioners is say ""not now"" or ""not with me.""

We need more discernment in this field, not less. More practitioners willing to turn down money when the fit isn't right.
