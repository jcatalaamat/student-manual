# Notion Portal

Perfect. Here’s your Notion Portal, structured and written for immediate publishing. You can copy-paste this directly into Notion or let me build it for you if you prefer.

# **✦ Welcome**

If you’re here, it’s not by accident.

Something in you is softening, unraveling, or remembering.

I don’t offer programs or promises.

Just presence.

Below are the ways we might walk together.

# **🌀 1:1 Presence Sessions**

Clarity | Resonance | Soul Truth

These are not coaching calls.

They are sacred spaces to be met in full honesty — without tools, without pressure, without performance.

You can come raw, silent, joyful, wrecked, awakening, collapsing.

All of you is welcome.

🕊 For moments of:

- Emotional overwhelm
- Soul awakening or ego death
- Transitions, grief, inner collapse
- Post-ceremony integration
- Or just wanting to feel yourself again

✴ Format: 60min via Zoom or voice

✴ Sliding scale: €55–€144

✴ To book: [Your DM / email / link here]

# “You met me where no one else could.”

# **🐍 Bufo Work**

Preparation | Ceremony | Integration

I work with Bufo Alvarius — not as a trend, but as a portal to Source.

This medicine dissolves everything false.

It’s not a psychedelic.

It’s death. It’s light. It’s truth.

If you feel called, we begin with a conversation.

This work is never advertised. Only offered by resonance.

🌿 I offer:

- Energetic + emotional preparation
- In-person ceremony (Mallorca / Mexico only)
- Post-ceremony integration (weeks or months later)

You do not need to sit with the medicine.

Sometimes, presence is enough.

✴ To begin the conversation: [DM or email]

# **✦ Words from Others**

# “This wasn’t healing. It was truth.”

# “You held me in silence until I heard myself.”

# “I didn’t know I could cry like that. It felt like God.”

# “I finally came home to my body.”

(Add or replace with real testimonials when ready.)

# **🤍 Contact + Flow**

I move slowly.

Nothing is rushed.

If this is for you — you’ll feel it.

# **✴ Optional Closing Quote**

# “This is not coaching.

# It’s companionship at the edge of what you thought you could hold.”
