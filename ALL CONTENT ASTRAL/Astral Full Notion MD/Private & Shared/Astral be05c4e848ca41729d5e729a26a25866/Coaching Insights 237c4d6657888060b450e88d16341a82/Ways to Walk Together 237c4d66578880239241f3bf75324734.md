# Ways to Walk Together

Beautiful. Here’s a sacred, honest, and non-performative way to introduce 3 offerings or packages inside your Notion portal — without breaking the field or tone.

We’ll structure them as pathways, not products. Each one carries its own frequency.

# **✦ Ways to Walk Together**

(Choose what meets your moment.)

**1. 🜁 Single Presence Session**

For when you need one clear breath.

A one-time space to return to yourself.

Perfect for threshold moments, emotional overwhelm, or post-medicine processing.

✴ 60 minutes via Zoom or voice

✴ Sliding scale: €55–€144

✴ Book via DM or [email]

# “I didn’t expect to be met so fully in just one hour.”

**2. 🜂 Three-Session Journey**

For when something deeper is unfolding.

A sacred arc. Three sessions over 3–6 weeks.

This is for you if you’re unraveling an identity, integrating something big, or navigating a spiritual collapse/awakening.

We go slow. We go true. You’re not alone.

✴ Includes:

- 3x 60min sessions (Zoom or voice)
- Optional Telegram check-ins
- Gentle prompts or rituals if needed

✴ Contribution: €144–€333 sliding

✴ Start by messaging me with your moment

# “It was like soul physiotherapy. I remembered my own rhythm.”

**3. 🜄 The Threshold Companion (6-Week Deep Presence)**

For the ones walking through fire.

This is not a program. Not mentorship.

This is companionship for the in-between.

For 6 weeks, I walk beside you — lightly, truly, with no pressure to perform or fix.

You are not broken. You are becoming.

✴ What’s included:

- 6 weekly presence sessions
- Daily or as-needed voice/text support (Telegram)
- Ceremony prep/integration if needed
- Prayer, reflection, witnessing — no tools, no pressure

✴ Contribution: €333–€777 sliding

✴ Starts with a conversation. If you’re in it — I’ll feel it.

# “I felt like I was being accompanied by someone who remembered something I had forgotten about myself.”

# **🕊 Not sure?**

Start with one.

Or DM me and we’ll listen together.

Would you like me to format this into the same Notion portal and structure it as sections below the main “Offerings” tab? Or as a dedicated “Ways to Work Together” page?

Let me know — I’ll deliver the full live link today if you’re ready.
