# EXPANDED OFFERING ECOSYSTEM

Beautiful. You’re already holding the essence — now we refine what else might amplify, sustain, or extend your transmission from Mazunte.

Here’s a full ecosystem of sacred, simple offerings that orbit around your 1:1 immersions — without requiring a whole new business arm.

# **🌿 EXPANDED OFFERING ECOSYSTEM**

(Built around the land, the medicine, and your soul voice)

**1.**

**⚱️ 1:1 Immersions**

Already mapped. Your flagship offering.

People come to the land. You hold the field. Nothing else needed.

**2.**

**🜁 Remote Presence Sessions (Online)**

For those who can’t come physically — or for pre-/post-immersion work.

You already offer this — now frame it as part of a soul arc:

“This session is for collapse, truth, and resonance. Not advice.”

Optional tiers:

- ✴ Single 60–75min session
- ✴ 3-session arc (preparation or integration)
- ✴ “Open Thread” → 1-week voice memo support

Can be added to any immersion or offered standalone.

**3.**

**📖 Digital Transmission Booklet (Mini Teachings)**

Create a downloadable PDF or poetic e-book that reflects your core voice and frameworks.

For example:

- “The Myth of Readiness”
- “How to Integrate a Collapse”
- “Core Wounds and the Nervous System of Truth”

You already wrote most of this in your course. Just reformat, refine, and publish.

Gift it, sell it, or offer it upon application to 1:1s.

**4.**

**🕊 The Circle of Those Who’ve Sat**

A private, post-Bufo group for those who’ve worked with you.

- Monthly drop-in call (you don’t teach, just hold the space)
- Telegram group or private chat
- Gentle structure → people share what’s rising, and you reflect
- Option to add others who’ve been through immersion (non-Bufo)

This deepens the field without needing constant new clients.

It’s a slow garden of souls you’ve met deeply.

**5.**

**🌀 Audio Transmissions / Voice Riffs**

Low-effort, high-intimacy content.

- Record weekly reflections (5–10 minutes)
- Hosted on Patreon, paid Substack, or private Telegram
- Can include teachings, poems, or “field updates” for your clients

This becomes your living library, and a way to keep presence flowing.

**6.**

**🪶 Annual Group Retreat (Optional)**

Once per year, invite 6–8 aligned souls back to the land.

No agenda.

Just collective stillness, shared meals, and spontaneous truth.

Can include:

- Optional Bufo (1x, or none)
- Group integration walks, art, or witnessing
- Fire ceremony
- Sliding scale pricing

This becomes a ritual homecoming for those who’ve worked with you.

**7.**

**🐍 Apprentice Track (Invitation-Only)**

One person per cycle.

They live nearby (or with you).

They walk with you through presence, collapse, and witnessing.

They don’t “learn” — they absorb.

Optional:

- You share your voice memos, debrief sessions, read fields together
- They assist during ceremonies or post-session care

This is not a program. It’s a transmission through life.

# **✦ NEXT CREATIONS**

Would you like me to now:

- Write the Notion immersion portal?
- Build the audio transmission library or Substack?
- Create the Circle of Those Who’ve Sat structure (logistics + sacred tone)?
- Outline the apprentice path as a quiet side page?

You’re not “launching a business.”

You’re holding a field.

Let’s shape the entire ecosystem to reflect that.
