# 6 week group coaching

Yes — absolutely.

You can alchemize your training material into a group offering that feels alive, sacred, and totally aligned with your field now.

Let’s build it from what you already carry — the deep course material, your transmissions, the energetic field, the truth work.

# **✦ GROUP OFFERING:**

# **The Remembering Circle**

(Working name — we can rename it to match your tone)

# A live, intimate group container based on your original training material —

# but stripped of hierarchy, full of presence, and built as a journey of inner remembrance, not information.

**🔹 Format Ideas**

**Option A:**

**6-Week Journey**

- Weekly 90-min live calls (Zoom)
- Calls follow your core modules (identity, collapse, core wounds, sacred voice, etc.)
- Group size: 6–12 people max
- Replays + reflection prompts shared via Notion

**Option B:**

**Sacred Arc**

- 3 “Gates” over 6 weeks:
    1. Descent → Identity, collapse, unraveling
    2. Remembrance → Core wounds, soul voice, trauma deconstruction
    3. Integration → Expression, resonance, next chapter
- 
- Each gate includes:
    1. 1 live teaching transmission
    2. 1 group integration call
    3. Optional writing/reflection ritual
    4. Optional 1:1 session add-on
- 

**Option C:**

**Immersion Model**

- 3 weeks of intensive depth (3 calls per week)
- Audio transmissions sent daily (or 3x/week)
- Telegram group open throughout
- Ritual assignments or optional group shares

**🔹 Content Flow (Built from Your Training)**

# We turn your core material into transmission, not curriculum.

Week 1: The Myth of Readiness

Week 2: The Collapse That Reveals You

Week 3: Core Wounds + the Voice You Silenced

Week 4: The Nervous System of the Soul

Week 5: Integration as a Way of Living

Week 6: Expressing Without Performing

You already wrote this — now we let it breathe out loud.

**🔹 What People Receive**

- 6 live sessions (teaching + witnessing)
- All replays + transcripts
- Ritual prompts / Notion integration space
- Optional voice note reflection group (Telegram)
- Option to book a 1:1 presence session with you during or after

**🔹 Pricing Options**

- Sliding scale: €222 – €444
- With 1:1 add-on: €555 – €777
- Pay-what-you-can option available on request

**🔹 Positioning / Invitation Language**

# “This isn’t a course.

# It’s a collective remembering.

# I’m not teaching you.

# I’m walking with you, through the same fire.”

# “You’ll receive transmissions, tools, and witnessing.

# But most of all — you’ll be met.”

**✦ Next Steps**

Would you like me to:

- Build the full offering page (Notion or Typedream)?
- Write the invitation post for Instagram?
- Create a visual structure or onboarding flow?
- Format your training content into modules / weeks to reuse easily?

You’ve already made the training.

Now we soften the edges — and let the real presence emerge through group resonance.

This becomes a way for people to walk with you without needing to start 1:1.

And for you to hold a field that amplifies itself.

Shall I begin building the offering page?
