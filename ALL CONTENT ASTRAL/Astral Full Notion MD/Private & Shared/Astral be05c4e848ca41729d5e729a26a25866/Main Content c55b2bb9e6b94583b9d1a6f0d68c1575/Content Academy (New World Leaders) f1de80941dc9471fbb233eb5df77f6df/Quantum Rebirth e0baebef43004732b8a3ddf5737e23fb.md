# Quantum Rebirth

Quantum Rebirth is a system, a philosophy, a lifestyle, and a socio-spiritual movement.

Leading (society and humans) to transition to a new way of living/being. 

Quantum rebirth is a revolution leading Humans to become their most expanded and updated form 

Becoming the most evolved possible version of humankind.

Perspective and guide

Quantum Rebirth Academy includes the foundational training, the basics, the vision, and then there are modules that are in depth about each point and allow further evolvement into them.

What we first bring is an Attunement or an introduction, it goes thru all the points but non exhaustibly. Opening the curtain and showing you the landscape.

There is a seminar which is an introduction, the first thing. It's about accessing the philosophy. It has basic concepts of clearings. Attunement is important. Introduction to a new way of being. A basic tool for clearing themselves.

Then there is the foundation which is extensive and goes thru every point.

Then there are the modules.

-

Ascension, multi dimensional being, clearing past to become a new evolution, a new species, creating a new reality,  

-

How does it work?
In a typical session we will use a wide range of tools - active listening, questioning, deep presence,conversation, meditation, bodywork, sound, visualisation and breathwork - to bring you into a light trance state of consciousness. The theta brainwave, a very relaxed and conscious state, creates a direct access to the subconscious mind. Here you are guided to the root of your limitations ,allowing traumas to be released and reprogrammed on a subatomic level.

THE TRANSFORMATIONAL THERAPY

Who are the facilitators?
Nina Moore and Jee Ka Avtar are exploring what it means to be a conscious being.
Since they found themselves together they have been fully dedicated to self-transformation,
clearing their past and discussing their views about the universe.
Constant seekers and eternal students, they use every opportunity to grow and expand their beingness,
sharing their knowledge and their unique gift to create a complete experience.
Their aim is to be the best contribution to the Earth possible, by empowering others to transmute
their limitations and to become the highest version of themselves. They participate
in creating a New World of awakened beings to lead us into a different way of living.

VISION 

What is quantum? 

- ~~We are made of both particles and waves - which means we are made of energy - particles (of light) are both matter and energy, depending what you expect the result to be (via a measurement)~~
- ~~99.99% of our physical bodies is made of space in the atomic level~~
- ~~Observation modifies the physical reality - observer effect~~
- ~~quantum entanglement & quantum field - information travels thru space at and everything is connected~~
- ~~Two or more realities exist simultaneously - schrodinger~~
- ~~96% of the universe is invisible~~
- ~~quantum has no time~~
- ~~quantum world~~
- ~~quantum suggests that we perceive a tiny fraction of reality~~
- ~~time is an illusion~~
- ~~upbringing, environment, genetics, influence how we see the world~~
- ~~we create our reality with what we think, believe, perceive and the language we speak~~
- ~~limit of language is the limit of the world~~

A quantum reality may be more than real. With all the scientific discoveries of the latest centuries we find that when we reflect on some of the quantum facts we discover a totally different reality.

We know that 96% of the universe is something unknown to us, with 4% being all matter in galaxies. 99.99% of our physical bodies are made up of space. This proves that the observable reality is far from the Truth of that Reality.

Quantum Physics describes that the smallest particles that make up matter are both particles and waves, and that they are either one or another depending on what we are looking for. 

Matter is made up of Energy.

Quantum Field and Quantum Entanglement shows us that everything in the universe is interconnected and all parts affect all parts. Information travels through space with no apparent medium.. In a Quantum World, there is no Time, and rather a smooth continuum. Quantum Superposition tells us that all possible realities exist simultaneously - and that our observation alters the that which is being observed. We solidify the reality that we are expecting to see.

It has been proven that education, upbringing, environment, genetics & life events, influence how we see the world, that we create our reality with what we think, believe, perceive and the language we speak, and that the limit to our reality is bound to the limitations of our language.

The way you expect the world to be locks you into thoughts, beliefs and points of view. These perceptions may be limiting you. You shape reality by your reaction to your experience of the world. It is possible to instantly clear and reprogram your being by changing
your perspective on what has been and focusing on what it could be.

Rebirth

Going through rebirth is an Initiation in a radically renewed way of being

It is Coming back to life as a quantum Human .  

its a complete reset and the begining of a new paradigm of existence as a being that understands how to generate a reality that matches his highest potential 

 its the reception of a new, spiritual principle of life during the present physical existence.

 With renewal of the cosmos in the age to come, We reawaken to our truth 

Attaigning complete regeneration of the multidimentionality of your being, activating you DNA as you awaken dormant strands 

reaching a new comprehension of the inter connectivity of all things 

attunement into the most expanded and updated constellation / pattern /  pathways 

spiritual regeneration 

renaissance 

new creation 

As you are reborn- we go through the death of the old world to see a new one emerging from the ashes 

attainment of a new life and salvation

becoming divine - higher aspect - spirit - spark
