# Inner Child

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ What is the worst thing if everything you ever believed to be True when you were a child, it actually was True, and you could have tapped into all of that wisdom and grow up with it, instead of having let others and yourself mark it as obsolete, as not real and delusional and thrown it?

# Meditation 1

Let's go back in time to when you were a child and wanted to go to the stars, or wanted to just help people get better, in any way you wanted it. Who told you you were not to do that, that wouldn't be the best option, that only too few would be able to do that and it was best for you to step away soon enough not to get hurt like them for trying to achieve dreams.

What would happen if you were to be compassionate towards what's happened to you in the past? What you have done to yourself? What you have done to others? 

If you could accept it and let it go, fully. If you could see that you actually learnt something from it and that in a certain way it was the best way you had at the time to learn something, and you can learn different now?

What did you want life to be like when you were a child?
