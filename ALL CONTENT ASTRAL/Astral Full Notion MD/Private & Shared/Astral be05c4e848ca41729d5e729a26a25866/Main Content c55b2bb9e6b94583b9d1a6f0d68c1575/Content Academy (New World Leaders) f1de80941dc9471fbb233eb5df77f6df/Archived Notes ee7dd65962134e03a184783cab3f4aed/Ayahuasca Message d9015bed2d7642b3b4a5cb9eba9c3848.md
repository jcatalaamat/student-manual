# Ayahuasca Message

Hi beautiful you!

I have been off the radar for the last 6 months undergoing a massive transformation. I've spent most of this time working on myself and becoming more of what I truly am.

I would like to let you know that I'm inviting you to a crossroads on the self transformation journey. 

Partnering up with two beautiful people, we've created our greatest retreat up to the day.

We're going on a 4 day 3 night journey including an ayahuasca ceremony with a 15+ year team of facilitators, 3 private transformational sessions with certified therapists and a bunch of other events during your stay, all in a beautiful nature resort in the South of Spain. 

This is definitely our best offering as a transformational team of people.

If you have been feeling like there was something big coming soon in your life, this is probably it! If you're feeling curious about it, please reach out and I will delightfully explain more about it. 

With the covid restrictions being eased, it's an easy and great opportunity for having a holiday in Spain and becoming more of who you truly are. We may be able to support you on your way back to your country, if necessary. 

I attach you the syllabus with all the information and don't hesitate to ask for more information if needed.

We have 11 spots left so don't let this chance go away.

With all the love I am,

Jee Ka Avtar (formerly Jordi Catala)

PS: I will be offering more retreats, workshops, trainings and mentorship programs soon (both online and in-person). Reach out for more info!

PS2: I am happy to be reconnecting with you again and see in what way our creationship will move us forward.
