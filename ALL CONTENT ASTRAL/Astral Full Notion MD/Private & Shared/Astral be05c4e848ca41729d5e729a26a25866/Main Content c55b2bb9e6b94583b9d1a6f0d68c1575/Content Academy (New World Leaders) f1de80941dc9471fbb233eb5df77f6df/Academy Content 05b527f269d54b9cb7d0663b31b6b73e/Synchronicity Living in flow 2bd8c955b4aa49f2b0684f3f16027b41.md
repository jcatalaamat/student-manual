# How to align and activate yourself to awaken your true power

 

### INTRODUCTION

You are feeling that something is missing ? A connection to yourself ? a to your Divinity, to your higher aspects ? A sense of ease, of alignement and flow , that is giving you confirmation that you're on the right track? How can you trust that there is something bigger than you - an AWAKEN you, a future you, that is leading you towards your destiny ? 

When you awaken to yourself the veil of Illusion of a solid reality is fading away as you realise that your experience is fully subjective and therefore that you are the master of your life . 

Your energy attracts what you project, by resonance . Being in synchronicity is being free from the patterns that are limiting your perception and your choices . 

When you choose from a space of unawareness - because you dont know better - carrying the projections of others, of society , or assuming that you still are the person you were a month - or a week - ago, you are living from the mind and choosing "rationally" . 

Here , we are learning how to break free from what you thought was the way to lead your existence to truly surrenderring to what is most aligned for you .

    Checking your life : Is your job something you chose ? 
    
    If yes , how and when ? are your parents doing the same job // career ? Is it a job that is aknowledged by society for being a "good" job ? Is it something that you chose being a child or a teen? Are you successful ? Are you fulfilled ? 
    
    VS // The vocation emerged sudnly, I felt called to study something that seemed out of my field of interest // I found myself stepping into something that I wouldnt have expected // I was asked by people around me to help / support them 
    
    Is your partner someone you chose following criterias , because he / she was "ticking all the boxes" ? 
    
    VS// That person appeared "out of the blue" / Is not someone i Thought i would pick to be with me / it was an irresistible attraction / I was out of control / energy awakening in me 
    
    Do you feel emotionnaly supported in your realtionship ? Are you happy ? Do you feel truly Intimate with your partner ? Do you feel seen , understood? 
    
    If you answered YES to those 2 propositions you might  have been choosing from a space of control , to make sure that you wont do the wrong choice / that you would be validated by yourself or others . Can you observe that space in you . The perspective of your parents, the way you have been raised,  the fears that had been conditionning you into choosing what feels "safe" "accepted" "acknowledged" . are you ready and willing to let go of your zone of confort tu step into your true self ? 
    

### HOW TO SHIFT

The 1st step is to observe everywhere that you are limiting yourself with judgements : "this is too crazy" or with guilt "its too good for me" so you can let go of anything that is keeping you from aligning to your highest purpose . remember, it is not that you are alone or that there is nothing for you, it is not because the universe doesnt care about you, it is simply because the chatter of the world - collective inconscious - and your mind is too loud for you to be able to listen to the soft voice of your inner guide, of your soul longing, of what is the next step for you to become who you are .

### BECOMING INTENTIONAL

Placing intentions into your actions and relationships is giving direction to them and giving power and force to what they have to offer as a potential of growth . each moment is an opportunity to tune into what is making you vibrate, giving you joy , and what is truly bringing a feeling of expansion . Intentionnality works in many ways . 

it starts with daily routine and its also placing long term intentions and learning how to release them into trust 

I call that planting seeds and INVITATION for your life to shift . Its sending a message to the universe : I am ready , ready for change , to step up, to listen to my heart . Its an energy of CALLING IN, and it doesnt leave any space for lack and vibration of fear or blame / resentement

Intentionnality is also a willing to observe the SIGNS . Numbers , objects, reccurent symbols, adds on internet , old friends reappearing,  gifts, and more subtle , energy of places, sensations in the body (shivers, smells, tastes) . Starting to discern what are those signs telling you and first of all, how to trust into them and not dismiss guidance by a lack of curiosity . 

Learn How to SLOW down To be able to observe more. As you slow down you become also more sensitive and more aware of the energies coming through you .Sometimes we avoid inconfortability of our current situation by rushing through life and with slowing down you also face aspects of yourself that you hadn't had the chance to meet yet. Realising parts of your life that you dont resonate with anymore . And finding your own inner rythm, you enter into a vibratory field of synchronicity . Now, look around , it seems like the universe is speaking to you through everything : the smile of a child, a flower blossoming, the light of a morning sky . as you fall in love with the world, the world falls in love with you , through the beauty and through poetry. 

JOURNALING

  Learn to be less BUSY and more empty to allow more and more space to SPONTANEITY . Spontaneity is choosing from your heart space . its following the lead of your body as he is guiding you somewhere , Its suddenly calling someone that you havnt talked with in a long time, its running under the rain naked, its finding yourself doing something that you haven't PLANNED . SPONTANEITY is the transition between Knowing From the mind TO Trusting With the Heart - KNOWINGNESS ( higher knowing) it will bring you through a portal of resistances : "I dont know what i am doing and its scary/ upsetting" . It's because your ego - mind is loosing control ; and he doesnt like that : loosing control is Dying a little bit . Stepping into the unknown is being surprised by ourselves and its the highest activation : you find back the Juice of life, the nectar of bliss : the orgasmic pleasure of existence . 

GRATEFULNESS is a mindset . Its a high vibration attitude towards life . Is seeing what you Have rather than what you dont have . Its shifting your way of reacting towards what is happening to you and seing the teachings in everything . it is connected to RESILIENCE and sense of WONDER

JOY

Joy is the key .joy is an underlying truth that good or bad circumstances canâ€™t dictate. Its the pathway towards your inner child and the indicator that you are in alignement with your truth . If it tingles you, if it makes you smile, if every atom that you are made of is dancing in the idea of something, pursue it . No matter what, joy will lead you to exctasy and to the bliss of being . Joy is the state of flow, its the highest vibration that one's can hold. This is where you truly start to live in flow , enter Synchony and Awaken to your higher power. Joy is not Happiness. Its not a fleeting feeling but a way of being . Its a choice, a response .

CREATING TRUST is The  big step on the path towards yourself . beyond trust , is FAITH. Faith means that you dont need to understand _ To stand "under"_ but to follow what you feel deep inside . Often , this sensitivity has been repressed by judgement of others - and our judgements towards ourselves. The scientific mindset that puts forward the necessity of a Proof Is also devaluating anything that doesn't has a tangible explanation. therefore, we tend to devaluate our subtle feelings and negate the intuition when its speaking to us . Taking the risk of following the most subtle lead will train your mind to be more accepting and more spacious for your true guidance to emerge .

CHANNELING . What we call Channeling is a way for you to access informations about yourself and about any subject that could benefit to your expansion . You are opening a door of perception that is leading you towards higher realms of being . It allows you to tune into a deep wisdom and gain confidence into the ever flowing creative force of the universe. It is a way to interpret multidimensionality , and to feel that you are much more than your physical body and your mind . Then you enter a state of Alignement and the illusion of your limitations are dissolving. At that step , things around you are much likely to start shifting radically - You might suddenly find yourself quitting your job - discovering new skills and abilities, fall in love with someone, transform your life totally -

OBSERVING YOUR PAST . Everything that you think you know is coming from your Past, and this is the 1st way that you create limitation or create patterns from traumas . You interpret everything from what you have learn until that day .( Course in Miracles)  you are also made by your story . To break free is to claim back power on your story . Start by the experience of remembering your childhood up until now. You can start by this year and rewind back as far as you possibly can (Exercice of recapitulation) You will have suppressed memories emerging and recalling is also a form of soul- retrieval : a way to re integrate bits of your energy body/ emotional body that got frozen in time by trauma . This is a very ancient way of healing that is also a quantum-perspective of the self : as you travel through time , you gather lost fragments of what you have been as a way to re define your future - bringing consciousness to a wider encompassing self IS , ultimately, making you enter into PRESENCE (into the present)and therefore develop your magnetic Field and your capacity to ATTRACT (into the future)

BEEINGNESS AND PRESENCE . Beingness is everything that you are beyond limitations ; Its your infinite self , and its the state of being where you integrated your inner guidance . Beingness come through observation of yourself : The way you moove (body langage) the way you speak (vibration ) The way you breathe ( inner rythm/ Life force) the words you choose (an introduction on langage) . Knowing that nothing is a mistake or a failure - in that terms, everything that you choose to be and to do is PERFECT . yes, even having that argument with your friend or "forgetting" that item when you go shopping . THis is entering synchrony . You find yourself doing things not according to what makes sense, because you are following another "track" a higher timeline , a different frequency , where entering the bookshop will make you miss the bus, go back at home by foot (yes, it might feel upsetting) and suddenly meeting a person that has a particular message to deliver - might be an old friend , a stranger, or even a lunatic sitting on the side of the street . I like to compare that state to the "ANT WAY" Its a deep interconectedness where you live beyond the individual self and your action is a piece of a puzzle that encompasses the life of other individuals in a ultraconscious way .

MANIFESTATION AND BELiEFS 

Your empowerement starts with what you beleive yourself capable of . You are made of the sum of what you beleive yourself to be . Most of the time, those beleifs are unconscious . Their are on the way of your becoming when they are hiding on the shadows - you are not finding a partner ? You probably beleive at some level of yourself that all men are going to break your heart . You are not reaching the level of aboundance you wish for ? Someone that you trusted might have told you that rich people are selfish and lonely ... Clearing thoses beleifs require dedication and a willingness to DIG in your behaviour and everywhere that there is a TRIGGER, a very emotionnal reaction, or a definitive assertion "ALWAYS or NEVER", observe what is at the root of the attitude. If there is in you any resistance towards the fact that you are an infinite being with limitless amounts of energy, that is living in harmony with his higher purpose and attracting opportunities of expansion . You can MANIFEST ANYTHING by truly beleiving it - FAITH -deep down in your being . It also implies switching your perspective from being a Victim to being a Creator . Claiming souverainity is taking back your power - nothing ever happened TO you but THROUGH you, as you are the main character of your life AND also the director . 

You are finally finding the reason for being here, now, FORGIVING your past and understanding that there is nothing to forgive - creation is impeccable - and you embrace absolutely your responsability in the interconectedness of all creation .

Find a space where you can relax and focus :

FLUIDITY OF BEING 

We learn by experience . Nevertheless we also limit ourselves by experience  . Becoming Fluid is allowing everything not to mean anything . As you understand that you are conditionned by your past , you also stop solidifying yourself from what "worked for you" in the past - and you allow yourself to open up to curiosity towards who you are - constantly shape shifting - like a child. Your Personality becomes playful and rich as you step out of self limiting beleifs such as "I am shy" or "i dont like dancing" . You become an open space, ever surprised by the expression of your being . This is a heightened expression of awareness - as you dont respond anymore from habit or from "automatic Pilot" you question each of your choices and take action from an ever renew point of view . You are not resting on what you know but expressing your life force at every point . in shamanism, Yaki sorcerers from Mexico are speaking about "second attention" a state of great lucidity - and they train themselves by bringing slight changes to all their habits - very subtle changes of behaviour into the core of their everyday life - the hand that you use to open the door, the way you brush your hair, in witch order you prepare your breakfast- to bring real PRESENCE and to train the mind not to get attached on "doing things the same way they were done yesterday . Becoming Fluid is allowing yourself to explore aspects of your personality that have been suppressed , or are dormant .By expressing them you awaken a very powerful life force and manifest/ actualize  extremely fast - almost instantly- because you do not limit yourself in any way . 

Exercice - Make a list of everything you think you are / Observe how your opinion and your likes and dislikes seem to be defining you . Be willing to be the complete opposite of what you think you are and to do things that you thing you despise / 

every morning when you wake up actualize yourself and bring the intention of being radically different than who you have been yesterday .
