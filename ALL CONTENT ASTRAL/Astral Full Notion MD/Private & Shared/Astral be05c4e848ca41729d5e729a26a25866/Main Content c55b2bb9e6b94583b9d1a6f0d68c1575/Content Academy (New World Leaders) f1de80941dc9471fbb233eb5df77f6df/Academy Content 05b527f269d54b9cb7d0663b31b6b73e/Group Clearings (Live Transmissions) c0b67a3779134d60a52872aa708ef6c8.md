# Big Purpose

The purpose of this circle is to meet weekly for a live transmission on group clearings.

There will be a general enquiry at the beginning of each call to discuss where everyone is in a particular area of their live, with a voice or chat share.

Following up, Jee Ka will channel a group clearing, based on the topics that people has brought up, to deliver the maximum transformation possible for the group.

In some sessions, a person may be picked to be an example for the class, where Jee Ka will go over the person personal challenge and will work on it to bring that as a resolution for the participant and for the viewers.
