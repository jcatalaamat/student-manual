# Big Purpose

The purpose for this course is to bring awareness to the language that we use. How the word choice creates our reality

- Our language limits us
- Video per topic or word
- Without language we wouldn't create anything
- Words are symbols to a physical experience - an energy expression
- Best practices
- Forbidden words
- How to catch yourself
- Stop judging yourself
- Don't scream at a tree to grow faster
- Word etimology
- Know the meaning of the word - what it is for you
    - Did you know some words mean something in one language, and even the root is the same, their accepted meaning in another language is different?
    - Manipulation of language to subconsciously self-sabotage mankind
