### The therapy

Quantum healing relies on the principles of quantum physics that highlights the existence of a unified field of consciousness. When you are connected to that field you can unpack all the information available in the universe, regardless of any limit of time and space. In that field, every information can be create, destroyed and uncreated.

A typical session of quantum healing will use a wild range of tools - active listening and presence, conversation, meditation, and occasionally hands-on healing, visualisation, breathwork, bodywork and sound - to bring you in a trance / theta brainwaves state of consciousness. In that state, we can access the subconscious information in your brain and guide you at the root of your emotions, traumas, projections and limitations for them to be released and reprogrammed at a subatomic level. Reaching a complete awareness and connection to the quantum field, you are becoming your own healer, using your life force energy to transmute from within. A set of questions will open the space for you to create a new reality and become the writer and of your own story.

### The plant medicine

**What are sacred plants?**

Sacred plants, also known as teacher or power plants, are used for healing, to access the 
subconscious mind and connect with the spirit world. They have been used for ceremonial purposes by indigenous people for thousands of years and are found in many different cultures around the world. 

These plants have traditionally been used to heal body, mind and spirit. Sacred 
plants are here to help humanity evolve spiritually and some can induce visions, telepathically communicate strong messages important for our healing and soul growth and connect us with the Oneness of the universe.

They are powerful teachers that can help us to see the truth of our being, show us the origin of our problems and help us release negativity, often through physical cleansing of the body.

**What is Ayahuasca?**

Ayahuasca is an an ancient medicine that has been used for thousands of years by the indigenous tribes of the Amazon region and in recent years has gained popularity in the West as a tool for healing, personal growth, and spiritual awakening. It is an entheogenic brew that has traditionally been used for healing of physical, psychological and spiritual ailments, the expansion of consciousness and connecting to the spirit world through visions. The word “Ayahuasca” comes from the Quechua language and means “vine of the dead”. It is also known as Yagé, Uni, Nixi Pae, Daime, Vegetal and many others, depending on the spiritual line.

There are many different recipes for the preparation of Ayahuasca, but the most common 
ingredients are the leaf of Psychotria viridis, also known as chacruna, and the Banisteriopsis caapi vine. These plants work together to create a strong psychedelic experience. The chacruna leaf contains dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which is a neurotransmitter naturally produced by the pineal gland and has strong visionary effects. The caapi vine, which is a source of beta-carbolines, contains monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) which blocks the DMT deactivation that usually occurs during digestion. The vine is cleaned and pulverized and cooked 
together with the leaves until the desired concentration is obtained.

Ayahuasca affects the central nervous system by stimulating the release of neurotransmitters and increases the neural activity in the brain’s visual cortex and the limbic system, which is the part of the brain that processes emotions and memories. This can facilitate deep emotional healing, with the release of painful memories and traumas. It can induce expanded states of consciousness or a dreamlike state, which can cause a change in the perception of reality and an altered state of thought and emotion. It is common to have spiritual insights, experience powerful visions, communicate with entities and have out-of-body and mystical experiences.

DMT interacts with serotonin receptors in the brain and therefore Ayahuasca can elevate mood and enhance emotional well-being. Outside of traditional settings, it is being successfully used to treat psychological disorders like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and addictions. Ayahuasca is non-toxic and is not addictive.

**What are the effects of Ayahuasca?**

Most people begin to feel the effects of Ayahuasca between 30-60 minutes after ingestion and the effects usually last six hours. Each Ayahuasca experience is different and people react differently to the brew. The experience can be overwhelming and it is possible to feel euphoria and enlightenment while others may feel fear and paranoia. It is normal to have many different experiences during your journey and in the same night you may be taken to both the angelic realms and into the darkness.

The most common effects are sensory changes, such as visual and auditory hallucinations, increased sensitivity and an altered state of consciousness. It elevates heart rate and blood pressure. Although it is very common to cleanse through vomiting and diarrhea, it is not necessary to purge to receive the benefits and many people find deep healing in very pleasurable 
experiences.

Matter is composed of 99,999 of emptiness / void and void is composed of energy

the  quantum field of consciousness is telling us that everything is unified

The only reason why an information solidifies it’s the observation we are doing of it (cf Schrodinger’s cat)

same with the thoughts, beliefs, points of view, emotions, sickness

How you look at them it’s how you feed them.

Through this concept it’s possible to destroy / heal instantly / create / replace instantly / reprogram those beliefs / point of view, emotions

Same with our worldview your perception creates your reality

Material reality is constantly creating and uncreating itself and this movement is based on a continuous flow of information: matters informs the quantum void (contraction) which informs the matter (expansion) and so on 

So you can create and uncreate constantly
