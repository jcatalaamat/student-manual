# Self Alchemy - Transformational Journey

Dive into a profound 4 hour experience of self-discovery through a reality-bending combination of healing arts. Gather in a heart circle to transmute your wounds into light, release your traumas with energy clearings, let yourself be moved to embody your divinity, breathe through your blockages with circular breathing, heal cellular memory with bodywork activation, bathe in sacred sounds allowing the power of vibrations to alchemize yourself.
