# Nina & Astral

Hello! We are Astral and Nina, the passionate hearts behind the Inner Ascend Community. 

Astral, an energy healer, coach, and an expectant father along with Nina, is committed to creating a safe haven. A place where we can share our stories, support each other, and grow collectively. He is available around-the-clock (except for his much-needed rest times) for any support you may need - text, audio, or video, without any charge. He aims to create a culture of mutual support, letting his ego aside for a flat structure where everyone's voice is heard and cherished. Guidance with the Discord platform? He's got your back.

Nina is your go-to person for relationships and couple dynamics. Her instinct for seeing individuals' potential and helping them find their equilibrium is remarkable. She is keen to support anyone in need, and steer their healing and upgrading process. Her wish? To see this space blossom into a vibrant, open environment where we all feel safe to share about ourselves, our processes, and our projects.

We, Astral and Nina, invite you to join us on this exciting journey. Let's together create a place where the 'pathless path' of Buddhist philosophy intersects with the 'Beauty Way' of the shamanic tradition, and magic happens!

Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Welcome to our thriving community.
