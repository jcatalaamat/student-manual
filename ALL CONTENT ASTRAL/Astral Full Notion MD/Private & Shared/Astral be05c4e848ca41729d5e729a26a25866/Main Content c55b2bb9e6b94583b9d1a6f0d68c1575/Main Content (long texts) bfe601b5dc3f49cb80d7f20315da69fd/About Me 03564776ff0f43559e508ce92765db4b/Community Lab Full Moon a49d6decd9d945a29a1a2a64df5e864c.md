I began that day leading a Theta Healing Group Session, with 11 people.

I had a list with a few subjects to go over, but the reality is that I knew what to say during the whole session. A part of me knew all the time, with some information in my mind, of what would be best to say afterwards. I realised maybe I didn't go too deep as I stayed relatively medium depth into the subjects I spoke. But it definitely did cover a lot of subjects and supported a lot of different things. That was what was needed. I guess some Ego would have liked to go deeper with subjects from closest friends but that was that.

Channeling came through. Hand movements came through. Humour came through. Teaching came through. It is quite interesting as the posture of the Healer and the one of the Teacher felt actually very different. Teacher hold Gyan Mudra on left hand and laid back a little more than the Healer. Healer would move hands and keep eyes closed most of time. Teacher would actually look at the space above the head of the students and would find the answers as looking at that space.

Tingling would come to the hands as flow was reached. More flow, more tingling. At some point movement was needed in the hands to express that tingling energy.

The session went amazing. We actually went through quite a big energy release in less than one hour! The energy naturally terminated itself in the process. There was a point in where I just felt that the energy didn't want to flow more. Then I realised healing was finished.
