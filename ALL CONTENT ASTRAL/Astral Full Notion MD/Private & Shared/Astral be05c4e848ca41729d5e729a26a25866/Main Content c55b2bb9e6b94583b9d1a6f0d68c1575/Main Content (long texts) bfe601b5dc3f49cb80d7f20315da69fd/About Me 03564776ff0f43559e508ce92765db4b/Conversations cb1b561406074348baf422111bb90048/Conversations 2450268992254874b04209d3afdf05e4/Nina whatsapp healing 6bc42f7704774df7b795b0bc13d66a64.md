# Nina whatsapp healing

[10:33 pm, 12/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I have a symbols drawn, and I can ask to heal you
[10:33 pm, 12/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[10:37 pm, 12/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So many layers of things happened simultaneously just now like and explosion transforming everything in the burst oh I just donâ€™t have the words , I let go of the words
[10:38 pm, 12/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that is the thing that is coming thru, in the emptiness I heard 2 words of theta nd it felt so heavy and slow, then i felt some questions of access and it still felt better but slow, like i had to make all those things myself
[10:39 pm, 12/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: then it was just an energy and had to trust whatever is and remain positive about it as my ego does not get it yet, but no limiting words were allowed to me as much as this deep part of me wanted to excuse myself for taking the time it took
[10:41 pm, 12/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but if you say that when you said yes you felt sth, that is extraordinary and beautiful and great for me as proof that something did actually happen and was felt, I was worried about what would the belief be or how would you know what is shifting or if you actually needed to know consciously about what is actually happning, but had to surrender and let it be
[10:42 pm, 12/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: As you said it all happened in the quantum field
[10:42 pm, 12/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It is beautiful to shift beliefs without knowing we had them on the first place and without having to use any words
[10:42 pm, 12/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and to leave knowing something did happen

[10:44 pm, 12/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: When your heart was aching I was releasing deep deep deep
[10:44 pm, 12/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes that's the other whole part that just by being present i know things were moving
[10:44 pm, 12/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And then was totally empty
[10:45 pm, 12/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and my mind was still questioning 'how can we heal sth without even knowing what is and how can it be simpler that it can heal faster than other ways with even less words'
[10:47 pm, 12/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Energy .
[10:48 pm, 12/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Something of you came in my field and obliged me to face whatever was there like a very sharp blade or a pure miroir with its own intelligence
[10:49 pm, 12/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: And that intelligence expressed itself In me
[10:52 pm, 12/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it feels like triggering some process that does self healing or something like this and it does it
[10:52 pm, 12/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: No more words . Just staying in that presence .
[10:53 pm, 12/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[10:53 pm, 12/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: when I receive my own guidance is similar in the sense that my ego is faced with having to dig down on its own, and it feels very physical
[10:57 pm, 12/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Now here sitting in front of the screen is like a million of information is traveling in the silence and the tension
[10:58 pm, 12/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Maybe I just turn off the screen and stay with the cosmos
[10:58 pm, 12/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: See you there

# Explanation

There is a light coming inside of the person worked on. This light begins pushing everything up and clears the mind. When the mind is clear, the person worked on can't really escape by directing wrongly or not accepting things. It's all felt within the person worked on. She can't explain or talk to anyone about it. She is faced with doing her own healing because the practitioner has triggered this light that is a divine intelligence that we can all embody.

The practitioner is there to allow the person worked on to bring up the issue, and to capture the energy underneath, but without asking anything about it. The practitioner can see that there is an energy underneath the way the person worked on is speaking about it, something that is not neutral and balanced. Then the practitioner brings up what it is relating to, the person worked on may  find it as direct but will resonate with it. The person worked on will do most of the diggin on them until the practitioner feel it can say what it is. Then using the symbol for healing and with the permission of the person worked on, the practitioner goes into trance and just remains there in complete surrender to what the energy is, following it in any way it asks.
