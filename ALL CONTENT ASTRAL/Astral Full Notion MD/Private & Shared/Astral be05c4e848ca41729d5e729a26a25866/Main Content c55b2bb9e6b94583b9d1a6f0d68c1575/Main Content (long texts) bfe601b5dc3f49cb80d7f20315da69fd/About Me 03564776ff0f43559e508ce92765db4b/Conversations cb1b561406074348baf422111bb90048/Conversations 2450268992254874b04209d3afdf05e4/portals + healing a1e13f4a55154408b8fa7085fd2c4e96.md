[6:41 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but teasing you to engage in conversation
[6:41 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: LOL
[6:42 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: What kind of practices could help clearing the lense
[6:43 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: bitch
[6:43 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: 😂
[6:43 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Thats the only thing in my mind now wanting to try things
[6:43 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ahha
[6:43 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: pardon my expression came from deep inside my soul
[6:43 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Loved it
[6:43 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: no thats heavier
[6:43 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so its a lie
[6:44 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Why was this bitch expressed
[6:44 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: What triggered it
[6:44 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: because
[6:44 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: when u ask a question
[6:44 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: you activate my ability to tap into the universe and get an answer
[6:44 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but it makes me feel something that I am not ready for or I am readying myself as it comes
[6:45 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Gooood
[6:45 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It makes me like I wanna peal my skin of my body
[6:45 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: WOW
[6:45 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: What are you becoming ready for
[6:45 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Wow indeed
[6:46 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but maybe it does feel like that like a snake would peal its own skin
[6:46 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[6:46 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: What’s the metamorphosis is about , what’s next
[6:46 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Its again like i dont know myself when i begin flowing towards there
[6:47 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: An actualisation of yourself
[6:47 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Its not an answer I look but the questions is triggering the possibilities HA!
[6:47 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: which takes pressure of myself of having to get the right answer
[6:47 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: its not about the right answer but about how the energy of the questions makes us feel
[6:48 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Fuck yes
[6:48 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I got 2 extracts of a whatsapp message from my beautiful friend back in november
[6:48 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Be willing to be vulnerable, destroy and uncreated any decisions, judgements, expectations, separations and rejections about the thing in question and then ask:  If I choose this what will this create in 5 years? If I don't choose this what will this create in 5 years?
Expansion/contraction/vision/awareness - what do you perceive with this question, rather than looking for the "right answers".
[6:49 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: What do I desire to create? Get clear about the energy even if you don't know exactly what this looks like. You can then also ask, if I choose this xxx will this contribute to what I desire to create? Even if it doesn't make sense...
[6:49 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: access consciousness talked about portals, she helped me close one when I felt I was being used by the energy back in november around the time of san pedro, maybe before the experience
[6:50 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: If I ask you how many portals are actually open in or around your body, what is the answer that comes up
[6:50 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It’s powerful . Something in me is kind of resisting the energy feeling like it’s some kind of autopsy of the soul
[6:52 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Like mystery if you put too
Much light gets lost like a secret when told to everyone looses its magic when you say your power to someone it’s taken away
[6:53 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: what are you meaning with this?
[6:53 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: There are a thousand portals at every second
[6:53 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Trying to be clearer .
[6:54 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: My friend said is best to do things without having to have portals, by asking the universe how can we expand into everything we did with portals but actually do it without, and see if that newness works for us, otherwise we can always go back and change it back to portals
[6:54 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: same with entities
[6:54 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Okokkk trying to catch the essence of it
[6:54 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Portals would b possibilities?
[6:55 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: no
[6:55 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: portals take some energy just like entities would
[6:55 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it stops us from fully being in the boyd
[6:55 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: body
[6:55 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and scattter us around the universe
[6:56 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Would b like a hole in our field ?
[6:56 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes it is a way for us to get power but coming from somewhere else instead that from within us
[6:57 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Okkkkkkk got it
[6:57 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so because we havent figured out how to access that power from within we create links to other places to get it
[6:57 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: same with entities
[6:57 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[6:57 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ok
[6:57 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So it can also b energetic chords
[6:58 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes any way where we access power that does not come from us
[6:58 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so we're giving a part of our being to that to access it
[6:58 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: To answer. I’ve closed a lot of portals this last year . I don’t sense any of that things draining me atm
[6:59 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I worked that way for a while
[6:59 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Using a portal
[6:59 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It was so painful in the end
[6:59 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I almost lost myself completely
[6:59 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It was a huge warning
[6:59 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so can we close any remaining portals and let go of any remaining entities, knowing that you can always go back to it if you dont like what comes up, but also knowing that thats an accessed power that youre choosing not to access thru yourself but rather from another source?
[7:00 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes please
[7:00 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: What if someone is using me as a portal
[7:01 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ask yourself does this belong to me? if its hevier u return to sender with consciousness
[7:01 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: you will always be able to support others better when your power is within you
[7:02 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so you should be able to access everything you did with portals and plants and know how to thru your beingness, and anything that doesnt allow that to happen would you now transcend and transmute?
[7:03 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[7:03 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes yes
[7:03 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: She made a long statement for the portals and entities, Which I will not mention but will reference to what she did or whatever my beingness would do, which in this case is just refer to that
[7:04 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: 'whatever she said, I say' LOL
[7:05 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Wow
[7:05 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Some things came up to b released that I though were solved already
[7:06 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: good
[7:06 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: anything that that is will u transcend and transmute
[7:08 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[7:08 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: sweet
[7:08 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: much bettah
[7:08 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: she said
[7:08 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: After closing a portal things can seem very different and unfamiliar, rather than making it wrong and looking for a way or reference point for it to seem familiar again (by opening another portal) why not explore what this newness is and what new  space it creates for awareness. If it's not working for you, you can always go back to what you did before.
[7:09 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: after she did a few of these things on me I began having understanding of the energy that was making me walk in spirals that it seemed It was forcing me
[7:09 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: this came up from saying
[7:09 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: 'well this energy makes me do things and maybe im tired but it still tells me to continue' which was a sort of possession because we shall always enjoy that which we do
[7:09 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: we have free will even if we have a life purpose
[7:10 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and specially one time I said fuck it made me go walk outside waynes land and it didnt let me get a jacket so i was freezing
[7:10 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: because it did not understand of human condition
[7:10 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: i was doing work for something else which I was not really willing to, so it tricked me in some sort of way because I was desperate for help into my path
[7:10 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: which leads me to the next thing
[7:11 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: help != support != contribution
[7:11 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: notice the energy of the 3 words
[7:12 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: != means no equal in engineering
[7:13 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so when asking for, we ask for contribution, how can this contribute into my life, how can a spirit contribute to my life, how can a plant contribute into my life, not help, not support
[7:16 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I find the light/heavy tool a great compass if you're willing to be vulnerable and surrender to what it is rather than assuming smthg should be heavy or light.
Your limitations don't stop you, no-one else can stop you, but your choices do.
Each choice creates possibilities, but each choice is only good for 10 seconds. So many things have happened in the universe after 10seconds 🤣.
Give yourself permission to keep choosing, to choose the same or choose different.
If you could never do anything wrong and never fail, what would you choose in this moment?
Lastly, if I choose this will it create greater for us? If I don't choose this will it create greater for us? (me+everyone+planet or whoever...)
[7:17 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Wow
[7:17 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: That last one . So needed right now
[7:17 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: this was my friend answer to a few of my questions, well everything I shared was
[7:18 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so beautiful
[7:21 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: In the end . Is it really us choosing
[7:21 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so this is where us we're going deeper yes
[7:21 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: we're tapping into the idea that whatever is is in that way as if programmed by a higher consciousness
[7:22 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: this is why i sometimes clash with free will
[7:22 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes . And that all choices are the best choices because it’s the ones you’re making
[7:22 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if an energy comes thru me, at the moment I let it, I was always meant to be or do that
[7:22 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: That’s why I enjoyed this last thing but something in me was not resonating like
[7:22 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ha we said same LOL
[7:22 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Too much concept
[7:23 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So much wording
[7:23 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: the clarification for what she said meant
[7:23 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: what If I first want one thing then another
[7:23 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: how do i know
[7:23 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I was probably in between mexico and no mexico, doing viannas training or not
[7:23 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and she basically said surrender and see what really is true for you, and you can change opinion as fast as every 10 seconds, whatever is true for u then
[7:23 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: which means sometimes source will give us an answer that gets us out of one place but that is not a definitive answer
[7:24 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so for some time it was needed for me to think i was going to mexico and the training was a scholarship, so i would join
[7:24 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I’ve been changing opinion every fuckin 5 min this last 3 days
[7:24 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and at the last moment it changed and i changed too
[7:24 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So it’s funny that you bring that up
[7:24 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: just like a lil child that wants many things, that is our nature
[7:24 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[7:24 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I guess we can bring some more stability to it, add some discernment to when it is appropiate
[7:25 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It was needing for me to think that i would
[7:25 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So much wisdom there
[7:25 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but ultimately you're being the light for the other to see
[7:25 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: obv might bring up things on them
[7:25 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: So it’s about not getting attached to the desires
[7:25 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: The plans and projects
[7:25 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: thats when the term 'with total ease'
[7:25 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Be fluid like water
[7:25 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if things make u feel too uncomfortable when u feel you;re being you, then maybe its not really you, maybe the ego buys into the idea of 'i have to be like this now to be true to myself'
[7:26 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: this is why 'I shall sit all day long and channel' is probably not your truth
[7:26 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it may be at some point, light/heavy
[7:27 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if changing every 3 minutes was still making you feel lighter then good
[7:27 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: What made me feel better is to accept that the decision was not to be taken now and
[7:27 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Like in martial arts
[7:27 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: How to put the exact righ effort at the right moment
[7:27 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: that's awesome
[7:29 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Fuck this always
[7:29 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: 😂 i was waiting for it
[7:30 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Awwwwwwwwwwww
[7:31 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: That’s why all this blabla in what we will b in 5!years
[7:31 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Fuck that also
[7:31 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: 😂
[7:32 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: a full being does not need an answer and does not need to look into future
[7:32 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[7:32 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it just needs to be
[7:33 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I used this but realised answers were tricky
[7:33 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but forgot the part of
[7:33 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes cause the mind is coming in you see
[7:33 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Be willing to be vulnerable, destroy and uncreated any decisions, judgements, expectations, separations and rejections about the thing in question and then ask:  If I choose this what will this create in 5 years? If I don't choose this what will this create in 5 years?
[7:33 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Arg no
[7:33 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Lol
[7:33 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: made the question with the attachments
[7:34 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Maybe in 5 years I’m dead who knows
[7:34 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but I feel that question is transcended
[7:34 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Maybe I’m in a place that I have no fucking idea
[7:34 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: the idea is that sth that brings somthg good for today may not be the best option for a week
[7:34 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: shall I eat the avocado now
[7:35 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: or what will it create in a wekk
[7:35 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: then u see the avocado was best to leave for another day
[7:35 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: because u had a special guest and u wanted to offer it
[7:35 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes but cosmic intelligence knows that
[7:35 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: In a glimpse
[7:35 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes exactly
[7:35 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: thats why we transcended
[7:35 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[7:35 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it guides us into being that and choosing from the intelligence
[7:35 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: we're advanced
[7:36 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ahha
[7:36 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: We are without bullshit and brain candy
[7:36 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Without what is un essential
[7:36 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so what else is possible with our conversations and how does it get any better than this and what does it take to turn out much better than we could have expected
[7:38 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: expected -> imagined
[7:40 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: this is from book i sent, I listened to 2-3h but the my intelligence hasnt made me more but was very important when i did listen
[7:40 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: When u say dat I feel what’s next is // organize // develop // experiment .
[7:41 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and when u say that I feel lazy
[7:42 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: I feel like It’s asked from me to b a catalyst
[7:42 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Lol
[7:42 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: No time for lazy
[7:42 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: whats a catalyst?
[7:42 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Catalyst, in chemistry, any substance that increases the rate of a reaction without itself being consumed
[7:43 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ok so
[7:43 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: what does organize, develop and experiment look like for us
[7:44 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Wait
[7:44 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: What is this lazy
[7:44 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: We can’t go on with this lazy
[7:45 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: well the funny thing is that things come up when they come, we can't force anything that is not on its right timing. I feel I said that but then I asked the question. Because when u said organize develop and experiment it felt like its something I have to do, so felt like how can I do it
[7:45 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but when asking the question i opened the possibility
[7:45 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so I dont actually feel lazy 🔔
[7:46 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: 🥷
[7:46 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: but please let me know if u feel anything
[7:46 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if there's any laziness in me i want it out
[7:46 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so anywhere where I have felt lazy, given up, stopped, been scared of a project because the ending seemed far away or unsafe or too difficult, will i now transcend and transmute
[7:47 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes 🙌
[7:47 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and anything that came up when i said lazy will we now transcend and transmute
[7:47 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and anywhere where in our lives something has related to laziness will we now transcend & transmute
[7:47 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: from now on I can use will we TT it
[7:47 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: hahaha
[7:48 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: 😂
[7:48 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it's so funny the more we are speaking the more when I see I actually sees an entity
[7:48 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: as if I was a name
[7:48 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Ok now that lazy is out of the equation. Maybe it’s about the timing
[7:49 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it's so cool this new state
[7:49 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Tell
Me more
[7:49 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: 'I' mean the person that identifies with I, means
[7:50 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so the mind, the ego,
[7:50 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yesssss ok
[7:50 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it's a disassociation
[7:50 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so the intonation of the sentence sounds different in my head
[7:51 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I guess because it's a different energy
[7:51 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: it's almost as if because I am now consciousness I am speaking for Jordi
[7:51 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so when I see I it's like talking about the vehicle
[7:53 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ok so what about timing
[7:53 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: whatever that that is can we TT it
[7:53 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: what can we ask to open it up
[7:53 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: 🥳
[7:54 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: just sit with that consciousness and please let it show you whats asked now
[7:55 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if there would be a right timing for this, what would that be
[7:56 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: How would it be to totally trust and totally surrender to the beingness of myself and have total confidence and courage to move from there into the highest loving response all the time?
[7:58 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ok whatever is coming up from what you said can I TT it now
[7:58 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and whatever we have aligned&rejected with from what's already worked out from us relating this way can we TT it pls
[7:59 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: aligned-> bought into -> positive belief
[8:02 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: these feels very aligned
[8:03 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: omg and it's only 8pm
[8:03 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ahah
[8:04 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: so . we are here, seeking something somehow together , or using eachother as mirors for expression of something bigger
[8:05 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: today something appeared as being one peak, or one birth
[8:06 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: definitly a turning point
[8:06 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: idk why i feel like i need to be recapitulating
[8:06 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: yes consciously cant grasp it but energetically did feel like that
[8:06 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: go on be as u feel
[8:07 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: what came up that was this turning point
[8:08 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: we discussed the way the healing shall be done
[8:08 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and we spoke about consciousness reflection that creates the healing, or the alignment
[8:08 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: and we found out something, that it could b done just by presence
[8:09 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: if the presence is clear enough
[8:09 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: and how to create master // disciple relatiuonship in just a glimpse
[8:12 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ARGGGGGG
[8:12 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: fuck dat im struggling cause I dont know what in me is speaking
[8:12 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: i lack clarity right now
[8:13 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: ok whatever thing that is making us feel limited or stuck right now can we TT it
[8:14 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: how would it be to always know what in us is speaking with certainty, truth and courage, and to be able to follow up with it? and anything that is not we TT it
[8:15 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: all that in our beingness
[8:15 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: and everytime we got confused in the past with alll our different voices and points of view can we TT it
[8:15 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes please
[8:15 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so this makes me question how much of this work requires clearings like this besides the presence one
[8:16 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: like dain heer still does some verbal stuff, then he does the energetic stuff
[8:16 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so we keep finding that some stuff we're clearing with verbal
[8:16 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: the energetic stuff comes first
[8:16 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: then
[8:16 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: when you enconter some resistance
[8:16 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: verbal stuff comes up
[8:16 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: if the beingness of our beings had to integrate all these parts into one, how would that be? how much fun and play would it be and how would we be it with total ease?
[8:17 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: depending on the person
[8:17 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: anything that doesnt allow it will we TT it
[8:17 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Yes I can see verbal would support physical
[8:17 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: well, energetic "
[8:18 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: LOL i sneezed 4 times and 15 seconds later sth in home has fallen down on the floor
[8:18 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: like my sneezes are strong
[8:18 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: how can the wordin can be extremely simple and powerful in a way that each syllable of the words would carry and extremely pure and direct intention
[8:19 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ahahh
[8:19 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: so how would the words spoken in our work be the energy that is needed to completely shift someone's point of view
[8:19 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: read these ones quickly, i wrote earlier
[8:19 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: - Personal practice - what can I do everyday that gets me to connect and to surrender to the truth that is being expressed through me by being? How much fun and joy and total ease can this be?

- What kind of practices can I focus on that clear my way of seeing the world, my reality, my points of view?
- What actions can I take to feel like what I am creating is aligned with the people who receive it?
- How can I keep an easy record of what I am developing so it's easy to transfer to other people? In what format is best to work to do this?
- How is this work going to be delivered to the public?
- How is it best to share about this work for people to understand what is it about? How much fun and ease can it be to be it?
- How can I experiment with this new way…
[8:23 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: AWESOME
[8:24 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: just perfect
[8:24 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: let me sit with those
[8:24 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: okay :)
[8:25 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: let's rearrange when ready
[8:26 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ok how would you rearange
[8:26 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: hahaha
[8:27 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: the two 1st one seemed right
[8:27 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: I removed the word healing
[8:27 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: would be best to start grasping what we're talking about
[8:27 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes ok i see
[8:27 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: when we said consciousness
[8:27 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: reflection
[8:27 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: itself
[8:27 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: trigger sth inside of the person
[8:28 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: for them to transform it in themselves
[8:28 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes exactly
[8:28 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: thats why the words need to be perfectly chosen
[8:28 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: [0:03 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: Consciousness awakening itself in someone else thru someone else
[0:04 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Yes
[0:04 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: And it is an experience it's not a conversation per se
[0:04 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: It's like a virus expanding
[0:05 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: But instead of virus is consciousness
[0:05 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: You're infected with consciousness and it's a matter of time to expand
[0:05 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: It could take the form of conversation
[0:05 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Or bodywork
[0:05 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: Or anything that’s needed at that moment in time
[0:06 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: And it's intelligent of their own so will guide the host onto what they need to be from that point onwards
[8:28 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: but now this is about how to go to the next step so
[8:29 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: ahaha !! you have my kunda name there

[8:30 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: rational mind needs to step in to organise all the flow
[8:31 pm, 15/02/2021] Jordi Avtar: what if you being you was just enough? and that being was more powerful than doing?
[8:32 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: yes but something is like

[8:32 pm, 15/02/2021] Nina Piara Shanti: if you want to get things done you need to take action
