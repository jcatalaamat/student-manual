# Sky Bipolar Healing

-healing bipolar in me from mum

-learning to be with myself, be patient with my child for him to find words, as he was never allowed to be himself

-even he couldnt trust me because he didnt know

-healed all of this and began our relationship together

-released weed and beliefs of connecting to channeling with drugs

drugs channeling past lives - drugs own intention - save world etc and nature
braing and gut chemistry
trusting own inner voice

bipolar - mental ill - not knowing

illnes has its own voice - seems like mine

she cant see other person sight

trust and act like you trust so old patterns dont come back
healing is not spiritual bypassing
healing is an act of love, not fixing (when I am gonna be better)

spiritual emotional maturity, there's always growth, it never ends
is hwat keeps us young and working and challenge (fun)
deep compassion

let go of reason why not to be with your child (inner) and with you
conscious intend on daily basis,

quiet other voices, prioritise heart

listen god and angels and argue with them because they dont live my life (say no sometimes to them) -> its a conversation not giving them all power of every decision i make

god didnt make me empty, not empty vessel, there's still me here

full of gods love and ideas and gifts before i was born, i was made perfect

potential vs power is different

witness activation of power in areas of live and exercise those muscles

doubts killed more dreams that fear or failuer will ever do

meditate on faith, trust -> faith in yourself, life, and others

believe u can heal, do it, being whole

one virtue to make another work
