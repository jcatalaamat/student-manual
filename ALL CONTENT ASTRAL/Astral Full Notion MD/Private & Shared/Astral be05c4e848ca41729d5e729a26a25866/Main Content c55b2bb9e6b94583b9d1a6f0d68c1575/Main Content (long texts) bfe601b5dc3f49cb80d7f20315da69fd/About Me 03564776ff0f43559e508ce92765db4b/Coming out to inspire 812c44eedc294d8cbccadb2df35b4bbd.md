# Coming out to inspire

No: Yes
Yes: No

Hi beautiful being! Thank you for your curiosity in well-being and making the world a more conscious space!
How I found it? It found me. I met the right person and this person inspired me to do the same thing that it did. Then another person in my life was so excited for life that I got interested in doind the same. And then it happened again. The modalities were brought to me by consciousness and there was no second thought about if it was the right one or not.

Now this happened as a culmination of many years of self enquiry and questioning my past. It was a very slow painful spiritual awakening. I only got the healing tools toward the end of a very long cycle of trying.

Looking back I see the value of my specific way of becoming as when I did it and how I did it allowed me not to be attached to a particular modality anymore. I realised there was no one solution out there and the key of what I am to people is to teach that the most important change for someone is to find the magic and the power in one self. Then how it particularly manifests in anyone's life is particular to each, and in which case I am also an instructor and advanced practitioner in many of the modalities I have learnt from so I feel entitled to share many of the particular tools I have adapted from all modalities I have studied and mastered.

I would say that there are many modalities that are not complete. Many modalities want to hook you in their system and they are not openly speaking about each other as a way of completing each other. I have found myself in that game and eventually realised that it was a mindset I had to acquire. Then after combining many modalities myself I have found the missing keys that I did not find in any of them separately.

It would be great if you take a look to my website and get a sense of my energy and the way I work. then if you feel like you would like some more information  and to get a live feeling about my essence then we could organise a video or phone call and we can meet each other and I can also get a sense of where you are at and if it feels aligned that I would teach what I know to you. I currently transmit my knowledge and the awakening activations  and transformation or healing tools one to one.
I feel like this way the impact is much more strong than in a class setting as there is less room for slacking off and not truly understanding the meaning of the inner self realisation.

I find many other practitioners of the other modalities I have taken master trainings with are still in a very confused space and they require 'breakthrus' often.
That is something I have outgrown when going deep into the essence of the being and after awakening the magic within.

I wish you the very best and that this conversation inspires you. I let you the link to my website [https://jee-ka.life](https://jee-ka.life/) and if you would like to explore this further let's have a call together.

Much love xx
