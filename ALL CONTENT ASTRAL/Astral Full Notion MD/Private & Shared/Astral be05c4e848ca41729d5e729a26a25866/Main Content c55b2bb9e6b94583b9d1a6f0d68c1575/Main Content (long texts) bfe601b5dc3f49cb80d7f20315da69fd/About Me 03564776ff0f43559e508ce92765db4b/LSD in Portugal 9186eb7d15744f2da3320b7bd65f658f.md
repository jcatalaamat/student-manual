# LSD in Portugal

No: Yes
Yes: No

What happened on 21st September 2020 was not the Truth I was supposed to be awakened at that day

# 2am

My intuition said take the lsd drop. After the first one, the thought cripples, what best to take the bottle with me and give a second drop. While walkin on the road it feels like the right time is there so I take the second drop and offer it to Finn.

At this stage walking on that walk is the most stable thing. I start saying that stopping would make it very difficult to focus on reality, so walking kept me centered and in the body.

As we reach the beach we begin merging with the surroundings. We begin to struggle walking in a group, slowly almost being swallowed by the currents of the winds into the water.

We set somewhere up in a dune. I set the towel and lay down. I begin kissing the towel as all feelings begin merging into one. I can feel what the others feel. I know they see what I see and I know they barely are in their body. Crippling thought of peeing and pleasure begin merging. Peeing and also opening the mouth putting the tongue out wanting to receive of the same nectar. All ecstasi from giving and receiving at the same time.

I begin merging with the bigger soul. I become and excrenuating action. Twisting and flowing and becoming one with the excrenouating feeling of being a molecule trying to survive in a sea of molecules.

Either you grow or you die, either you procreate or you kill, either you live or you die, you love or you kill, you love or you murder.

I scream all the heat coming out of me. My internal being is being squeezed. As my mind merges with the thought of the 3 having to become 3 naked monkeys pleasuring each other. For some reason the energy feels like I am being there for them to rape me. Everything had taken me there for these 2 man waiting for me. The looks of the surrounding merge with old past lives, in Japan and other places. They are giving me acigarrete as they have told me they are going to end my life after it. It is necessary that I exit then. The answer I was looking myself had forced that the truth was an exit point for me. So I had to leave Jordi behind, and I had to leave Amanda, and Sera, and fuck Marcos, fucking Marcos he was part of it. I called Cristina and they saw Cristina, and they corrumped the idea of Cristina.

At this point I felt and knew Keiv was there and he was the killer, the volcheur, and Finn is supporting as oh well we both are here for the same. We both are going to fill your holes and this is why we are here. This is what we are here for. You are here to receive even if you don't want, and receive this rape of Light and torture, and blood. You wanted to play with the Truth and the Truth calls up for your Death as an exchange of the Truth.

I am there and I am asking them why, they say it is what it is. What do they do after this? Keiv says we do another one, and another one, and he says it with such cold blood. He hands me over a cigarrete, and the thought in me says again now I know so now I must die for it.

I feel and connect thru Light language and Telepathy. I feel in them 2 different alien energies, and me being the third. I feel the intense pleasure and crippling thought of rape and pleasure and I say NO! This is unfair, it cannot be this way. It needs to stop. What needs to stop? Pedophilia, rape. It needs to stop. Is not fair. You need to let it go. And then it comes. We do this to ourselves. We are all source, and source does this to ourselves. But why with this rape? This innocence of fear, rape, murder and blood and viscera and twisted. They are cosmic beings that were leading me to that moment of death. All Bura was a trap, all life was a trap to force me ask for 'merging with source' and thar merging meant me having to die for it, exiting point. To understand it I had to let go of Jordi and I didn't want. This is my life, This is the life that matters. This is the life I want to be. I want to be in my body. I don't want to exit. I say no! You don't rape me.

The guys were weirdly asking to go to another place, more closed, as my thoughts were more clear that the immediate solution was nakedness, peeingness and self pleasure and penises and mouths. That is scary. Cannot be the meaning of life to be that and for it to have to be dead. And that us being Theta practitioners we are only a fabric of 'vessels' of people who willingly give their life to allow others to experience an early exit point of someone so transformation would happen to all around. I felt leaving my parents behind, and also feeling once I'm gone what does it matter. I am dead. They will find me dead. After all my parents will only be told that after I just took more acid and ended up dead.

I could feel them they wanted to get me to the rockes and in the rocks I just felt all the weight of mankind around rape and kill and I was just the next victim. This was happening forever and had to be like that forever. And pedofilia and murder were there as a normal part of the journey we had to live one.

Some were not able to scape this nightmare, and that's why it felt for me, walking the corridor of my own death on my own trying to find the way back to the only place I felt safe which was the van. But obviously walking all that path home was a way for me to accept that I had to die as a part of that journey. I had to accept I was dropping dead. But it was like that alien energy wanted me raped and dead and so I would just jump into another timeline and abandon who I was, Jordi, and Amanda, oh Amanda not Amanda. Not Jordi, not Sera. There was so much future, I don't want an early exit point on this life. I want this life to last longer. This is the life that matters, the one that has to matter. The one where we say NO! NO! NO! NO! It's unfair. No! disgusting. no! We do this to ourselves, why are we doing this to ourselves? We still can't understand who we are. What are we? We are symbols, groups of symbols around the universe. The symbols could connect and transfer those messages.

At this point I connect telepathy with the 3. If I make a mental joke I feel them laughing, if I reach a high point, they laugh about it and about me. They are laughing at my own suffering and they just feed out of my fear and blood and [death.](http://death.My) My own death corridor, the idea of people suddenly appearing my sides with knives and murdering me. Or me dropping dead. My mental chemistry was asking me that the most reasonable thing to do just there was for me to die. And if I got to be safe in the van, I would then become the perpetrator, and would do the same rape to Beth. And as I see Beth, she is part of it, like the whore who is given to me as a God, the last gift before I am sacrified as a higher Good for the Gods. I have all the tobacco in the world. 'How many more cigarretes are you having for me? Is the whole night going to last forever? Is everything that has ever been anything else than this dark street? Has all the universe been created for me to being hunted down right now and me needing to die? And me having this intense thought That the best was actually for me to just accept it, offer my ass and be raped and killed for it, that the whole light God path of surrender was a whole trap to allow the more ready to be vessels to be hunted and used as a satanic ceremony, raped and killed, to perpetrate the atrocities that are happening all around the world.

Beth seems like a whore, who always remained there in the van to just have me in my death bed and allowing me to pass over like a betraying snake. Like a wife that wanted me secretly dead, that was able to trade body and soul and sex for the truth, which was betraying to me and death under fear and blood.

I was in flow in telepathy. I could speak with all the Rainbow children, who had been in a near state, and they all had taken somehow part for me to reach that point, of being hunted by these 2 alien murderes. And me, a praying mantis, a pleaidian, was just one more abstraction to the game, and being hunted, just as it [is.](http://is.It) It is what it is. You can't fight it. This is unfair and it is happening. And you have to die for it. That's the price of knowing.

I was just saying 'This is not the Truth I was supposed to see today'. ' I didn't wanna see this truth Today'. It is not an early exit point. I am not dropping dead here. I AM NOT DROPPING DEAD HERE. I am surviving! I say no! this has gone too far! Not letting do this. I screamed at both images at the beach, Keiv and Finn, and protected myself. Even tho all my perceptions of what intuition was, source, love, was all part of the same game lie entangled that we were doing that to ourselves. That we were suffering. That we were taking different times of awakening, and then as a part of the game, the true awakening, would be that Keiv and Finn would have to kill me and exit me, and then move on from there. That had to happen. I was so scared I said no!

Walking on the street, stopping in some places,peeing on myself, feeling like what would it matter anyway, I was about to drop dead, it was my true death bed.

As i reflect to It is like mind wants me to believe that I should have gone for it and let it go but at the same time it feels like a very negative energy was craving that around the energy of us, so they had taken over the body of Keiv and Finn and were just there supporting my rape and death process. I felt all the pleasure, and also all the pain. I felt Keiv violating me and making me suck dick. and making me enjoy the pain of it. Disgusting. And Finn laughed and said it is what it is. You take it. NO! I DONT TAKE THIS ANYMORE! NOT THIS LIFE> YOU ARE NOT TAKING THIS LIFE AWAY> THERE IS NO EARLY EXIT POINT FROM THIS LIFE> THIS LIFE IS DIFFERENT< IT"S TOO EARLY. I DIDNT WANT TO KNOW THIS TRUTH TODAY. LET ME FORGET THIS TRUTH AND GO BACK TO SLEEP, LET EVERYTHING GO BACK TO NORMAL BEFORE WE TOOK IT. I WILL FORGET, WE WILL NOT KILL EACH OTHER, WE WILL FORGET THE RAPE, THE SHAME, LET ME FORGET. PANIC PTSD AFTER RAPE AND MURDER ATTEMPT.

If I had remained with them the alien energies just wanted us to gather and shine that divine light, which was asking us for a male orgy, and the thought of it was tempting, scaring disgusting, fearful and also pleasure, to feel all of it together. but it felt like it was a way to take my energy away and allow others to take from me. even being empty vessel, for god light. what if god light was playing poart on the rape of this planet. my consciousness was enjoying the rape as much as the consciousness was enjoyinh the raping. but it felt like that game had gone for too long. I was not allowing this. was not my fear of merging and enjoying dick, which i wanted, but was that that was imposed by some sort of 'light' that was cheating on us. making us remain in that cycle of blood and death.

In telepathy light code consciousness, i could love at the sky, and blink and make some wind sounds and we would all know what I am saying. stating clar the boundaries they were not ok tp cross. but they places this idea that what actually what i was always wanting to discover from source and being merged was that I had to die first.

On my pee on a random road, I felt on the floor, I had just missed it. Life had told me 'this was a near death experience, for you to realise you are the one who scaped, but could have not been that way, I could be the one murdered anytime, and things would suddenly end like that. I was seeing myself so many times murdered

I felt like a phoneix, being reborn from ashes. Am I coming back Creator. Am I staying as Jordi? This is the life that counts now and the only one. I choose to stay in my body. My safe body. I am not letting others take what it is mine. I am not allowing us to kill ourselves. We are trying to kill ourselves. The society of control society is just trying to kill us. Either we love and expand or we kill.

I felt like I had to fight Keiv and kill him in order for me to scape.

All the signs, the 2.11 and 44 in Angus van, the all other sign times. All was leading me to my death jsut there. an early exit point. But It was a truth I didnt wanna see then. It meant too much to the continue living that way. I had to die for it, for knowing that truth. The truth we were all seeking was the moment of death. What we all had been craving was the moment of death. But why are we using fear to die, and rape, and sex, and disgust, and twisted plots to make that more poainful and fearful.

I jsut wanted to lay in bed, If I had to die, in my safe space, even if Beth had to kill me or I had to kill or rape Beth. I wanted to be taken care, hugged, and maybe then I could be okay to let go an accept the truth I was here to die, to kill myself somewhow, how would I kill myself? I am allowing it to kill me? I am meant to do so much in this life. Don't Let Jordi and Amanda go just yet. Not Sera, please not Sera.

I am the victim, I am the perpetrator, I am the wound, I am the knive that kills. And the merging and the feeling of all knowing. I knew I was so much the murdered and the rapist, knowing I was also allowing and enjoying my own rape and death. The sex energy, the creating, excrenuating. The peeing, the pooing, the life process, just a molecule expanding for space and breath, having to either take or be taken, give or be given.

Why are we doing this to ourselves? And why are we still alowing pedofilia to take place? Why are we torturing these soulds this way? It needs to stop? What alien race am I? And the others? Need to stop. Am I pleaidian? Am I draconian? mantis?

And what is my candle going to help there? What is my love for god going to do there? my intuition lead me towards my death therefor all light had to be betraying us anyway. So how would there ever be scape? The rules were set by the perpetrators and they were choosing us to feast in our own suffering of blood and murder and rape.

I feel lik crying, back in the van in morning, already safe wit Beth. When I connect to the truth. I scapd. They didn't. Many stayed behind for us to be free. they remained trapped in their game of murder, We scaped the loop and I was just now shown the hard truth that I didnt want to see. I would never have wanted to see that truth, definitely not that day. that we do this to ourselves. Are we? Or are they doing this to us and make us feel like we do it to ourselves and that we want and deserve that pain?

It is like if my first exit point has to be my own exit point. I don't want anyone to show me that truth, I dont want anyone to push me out my normal exit time. I knew I didnt want to do acid yesterday. They wanted me because they wanted me to see thist truth. But I didnt want it to be my early exit point. I was not meant to become one with source yet. not this way. I chose to stay in my body. Not to drop dead. I feel inside i have the sweet stop where I could go to die myself, I just feel like that energy would take over and me would collapse in a seizure again and the body would shake till I would get a cardiac arrest.

What if becoming and being a vessel means death to me? Am I ready for it? When am I ready? Am I willing to pay the price to letting myself go?

Did I miss my chance to merge with source as an exit point for a source marvleous merging and then having come back superior? Or surviving this without exit point was the path I was supposed to take? There for the happiness from the NDE and it's learnings. I can still put my finger in my third eye, pull out, and see this machine of quantum where I can zoom in and out from time and space, tune in into different and parallel realities.

Any death happens from me to me. I always kill myself. Everywhere in the universe, it's always me  who kills me. And I have always chosen it, and it was always supposed to be that way. and I manifest it. I manifest my own death.

I saw amanda letting ashleuy rape her, it is what it is. we're the perpetrator, and we let this be done to ourselves, willingly. fuck marcos.

I have merged wth my essencer without the need of a forced early exit point. fuck letting go midnight gospel, all lead me to this moment of death.

My first exit point will be conscious. I will do it without the need of any plant or medicine. It is my own path and I do it my way. It was not the truth for me to see yesterday, but what day would it be best to awaken to this raw truth of eternal pain. since there is eternity there has been eternal death. as a process of life other process has to die. for one to live the other to die. 

Can I follow my intuition that way? Is my intuition always on my highest path? Can my intuition be hijacked?

why people trust me completely, can I trust myself completely? can i trust my intuition 100%?

my clear intuition asked me to do tonight. i manifested what happened, i did this to myself, i did keiv and finn to this into my experience. they were empty completely, they would have given me sex if I had let ti happen, they are in denial or forgot about it as they were possesed by the light.

and in my sweet spot it only feels like shaked and trembles as my own death comes, as i let the energy settle first before the final let go can flow.

what was that fear of even light has let me down, no god or source or anything is here at the moment of dying, is the total surrender to what you have believes till then and see what is after. i was so close to an exit point, i would have died, not sure if anything would be back

nothing else mattered as much as this life matters to me, this life is the one that counts, i choose to live this time, i dont choose death, i dont want to let go of who jordi is, and amanda, and sera. i choose life, the only thing i still wear is the red stripe, the blood, the life, the one life, this life.

thank you jordi for choosing life
