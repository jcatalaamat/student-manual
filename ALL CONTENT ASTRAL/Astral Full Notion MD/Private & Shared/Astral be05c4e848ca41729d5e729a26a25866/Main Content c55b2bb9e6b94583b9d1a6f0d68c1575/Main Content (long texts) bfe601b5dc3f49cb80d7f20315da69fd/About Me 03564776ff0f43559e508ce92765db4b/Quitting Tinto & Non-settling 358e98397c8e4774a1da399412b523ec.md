I am not going to lie to you.

This has been one of the most challenging times I have ever gone through.

Last year I quit my life as a software engineer, earning more than 10K per month and having become CTO of a company that was supporting mothers in motherhood. I had a successful career and a successful remuneration. 

I even was working in something that spiritually I was aligned with, supporting mothers to overcome depression and anxiety and other challenges during the motherhood journey. 

My colleagues took in all my suggestions into the business. I hired the team I was directing to develop the product. I had all of it by hand. It was a life come true.

Shame it was not my life.

I became an engineer because there was nothing else I could become. I never had an option. Society faces you wi

I had my first kundalini awakening a few years ago during the whole up

I have been working for 2 years to bring something new into the Earth. I have had to let go of the old and embraced the limbo of the unknown. I have had to go from doing to being. I have had to face the shadows of the past and cried them out. I have pushed through the barriers of what I thought it was possible with intense kundalini practices. I have practiced meditation for long periods of time for a very long time now. I have participated in many empowerment, leadership, transformative modern trainings in favor of consciousness and the development of myself in the spirit realm.

I have taken long time to come up with what my gift to the world actually was supposed to be and I have finally understood my place in the world as the transformative healer that I am.

I am a teacher.

I am a lover.

I am someone that hasn't conformed with what society has always said that life is and I have always questioned what we have seen as normal and pushed the boundaries of what is possible in life.

I bring something new to you.

I bring a new way of experiencing yourself and the ones that you care about.

Presence is the new way of living. Becoming yourself as the gift that you were always meant to be if you hadn't been projected all these artificial constructs that life has always had attached with it.

There is a change of paradigm currently in the planet. Haven't you seen it? It is a conscious revolution. The new time for us is around the corner.

We are awakening into a new paradigm of existence and I have had the pleasure to take my time to receive it in my being and to unfold it to complete understanding in my own experience.

I have created my reality and I am choosing consciously to change it now.

What if your inside was the reflection of the outside?

What if your experience in the planet was the reflection of your inner world?

What if you have been waiting all this time as a consciousness process in the universe to awaken yourself into a new form of living in the Earth?

I have heard your call to expand yourself and to release everything that is not you. That is why I quit my past life as an engineer of software and became an engineer of consciousness.

This is an invitation from me to you to become more conscious. This is an invitation from consciousness itself to become more of what you truly get to be if you chose yourself to awaken in the midst of this world.

There is a transformative energy running through me that has always been there. The gift I have realised myself to be is the understanding and the experiencing of the interconnectedness of all things. The realisation of my inner self as the creator of the reality as we know it. You are the one that has chosen your life to be the way it is and it has been from a place of unconscious choice. I bring choice to allow you to radically change the being that you thought you were or that you have always seen yourself as. If you knew there was more for you, I tell you there is. And it is greater than you could have ever imagined. The new paradigm of existence has no limits besides the ones that you choose for yourself. Everything else that anyone would say to that would still be limited because of how much they allow themselves to become fully the true infinite being that they are and the fear of loosing themselves in such a paradigm of existence.

Boundaries are key to this new transformation.

As we merge into the infinite realm of possibilities of being, the one thing that can allow us not to dissolve totally into the universe are boundaries.

Boundaries make you you. Boundaries allow you to experience ecstasi with those reflections of you that you allow to merge with you.

Total merging means your death as you know it.

Partial merging means you get to experience the infinite capacity that you hold without the loss of your Ego, or Mind. Basically this allows you to become One without going crazy.

Nothing is real and everything is possible. What we call real or unreal is just a construct of mankind as a step into full awareness and expansion of consciousness.

Judge nothing and allow everything. Transcendence comes from detaching from duality.
