# Calling for Nina

No: Yes
Yes: No

I want to connect deeply with a soul and see what can be channeled from the divine union that comes out of it. To open emotionally to the Truth of who we are and explore deeply what it means to be divine. To connect the hearts and to be playful and see what playfulness means for that connection. To analyse the effects of this to see how to apply it to greater scale to bring this to others. Understand its boundaries, how far it goes, what it means between the people who take part on it. How it can be applied to everyday life and what life becomes when embracing it.

To be seen by someone else who is totally open to respect and be okay with whatever comes out of you in order to open and understand more to the universal divine intelligence that is us. Without fear of rejection or abandonment, where anything goes into speaking to someone and how to play with that someone. How to make magic with someone, how to experiment life and discovery of another human being.

I feel trapped in my body unaware of the ways I have to share what is burning inside outside. I feel like there is so much I want to express and there are so many ways to do it that I am trying to find the ways to express them out. Dance, music, love making, stroking, eye gazing, making sounds, writing, painting, moving, shaking, making magic, transforming matter. I fear people will think I am crazy, or myself feeling that I am crazy. That I am too much. I am scared that I am too much. That what comes out will be so divine that I will melt on the way out.
