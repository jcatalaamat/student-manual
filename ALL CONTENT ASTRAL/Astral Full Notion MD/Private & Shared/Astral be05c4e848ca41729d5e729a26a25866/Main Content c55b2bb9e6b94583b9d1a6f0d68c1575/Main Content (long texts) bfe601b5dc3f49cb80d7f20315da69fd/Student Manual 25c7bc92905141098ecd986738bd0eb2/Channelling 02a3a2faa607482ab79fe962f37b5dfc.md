# Thoughts & Threads

When you become so empty you will realise your mind can't think some things it used to think anymore. That means that the energy that used to be there and its neural pathways is now gone. It's like all the reinforcement it had to be able to be followed again - the same thread of I am not good enough I am a victim all happens to me - it's all gone, so can't be thought of it anymore.

Consciousness is expressing itself through you, taking the essence of who you are. so you may begin experiencing that you cant speak the same way, and that is because who you truly are actually speaks in a different way - actually, from a different place, your heart.

I first realise I had different threats of thought, and that was because one thread of thought would trigger a kinesology response on my head. I would get a yes or a no depending my head would go left or right. But not all ways of thinkign were triggering that. That I called underthought. Or pre-thought.

On prethought - Intend.

Intend was like what preceded an actual thought. As if something underneath spoke the thought and only when it was strong enought it would be a proper thought. Thought creates form in some dimension. Intent happened so realised that anything on that level would be less toxic as it was not a proper thought, so I could play with what I was hearing in my mind.

Because of so many times having heard 'dont have negative thoughts' I realised that a negative thought would begin in an intent but would stop reaching the thought class. It would fall apart before. This way my mind began to become clearer and emptier, as I was not reinforcing any negative patterns. My life began lacking negative thought forms, judgements. They would just stop ocurring. Which made me go onto more beingness and positive thinking.

Now not only that, but a total use of my body physics contributes to what my being be's. I want to eat something, I can ask myself if that is really me, and when I go to kitchen, I can allow my body to reach things on its own, stop before I reach something my body does not want at tha point, or if I am pushy enough, my body what can do is weird stuff when it has something in hands that does not really want (walking on circles, walking towards a wall). This began after the san pedro ceremony when I began living more by the heart, and allowing the heart to recover it's dinasty over the body, having freed my mind from such a job. My hands began doing their own thing, texting or pointing at differents parts of the keyboard to give me hints about what my heart wanted. It was not straight forward and It led me to a lot of subconscious beliefs popping up about who is running me and is can I trust this. Surrender was key, meditating on the realisation that I am source and therefor nothing can really harm be as my energy is just too high for it.

I began channeling whenever an interested friend would ask me anything about anything I would find interesting, particularly spirituality. I would realise I wouldn't need to thnk the answe and everything would just come out of me. Many times with an epic answer, that once said I would be amused by the level I just gave and realising I had never said something like that. I knew from deep inside.
