# Why We don't like giving love

We do like to make choices that we know are not good for us. 

If you see a friend scratching their hand all the way to the bone, do you think it's worth it for anything they get out of it? You can't hurt yourself in one way just because you get something good from another. That will always lead do diversion. The goal you seek is being that which you are. If you keep choosing to hurt yourself in any way, you can't really grasp the Truth you are going for. Free agency gives you the power to choose who you are and what you are. What is more empowering?

Are you a random product with no reason being born anywhere for no particular reason into the family you were for no particular reason and be left unprotected into the world to do as much you can with all your limitations for no particular reason?

Is that how the universe creates a star? We come from a higher dimension than rocks. We own all of that universal intelligence that makes up All-That-Is. 

What if you were open enough that you could have created the best life for yourself? What if you could have chosen which life to be and for what reasons to live it? What would they be? Why would you have chosen to come to Earth to this time and to follow the path that is more aligned with you?

Wouldn't it be fun to be able to choose what our parents are meant to be? Where to be born? What experiences we'd want to have? If we were truly ourselves, without any fears, what would we choose for our lives? How would a life free of all of this would feel like?

What I teach is that which is real for me

# I Create My Reality

If I truly create my reality means that everything I believe in, does actually exist, and it has the whole intelligence of the universe running through it, accessed by our subconscious. What we believe to be true is in fact real, and we can access any information as we believe ourselves to be that.

You are the Akashic Records. And because of that, you may access it.

You are everyone. Everyone is part of you. You are that which is your main ingredient, and that is in everything else that is. DMT, the spirit molecule, you are the substance that you are made of. You are it by extension, scientifically. So if you expand the power of your mind into that which you are, you realise the immensity of what you are made of. You become a conscious creator in your reality, and you are free of all the old perceptions about how things have to be.

You carry a Light inside of you. The Universal Intelligence that makes up atoms and molecules, micro organisms, move planets and create stars. All that intelligence that works in the unconscious. 

That spirit, that conscious or unconscious intelligence, flows through you and can be you. Can show you what feels is right for you, just as gravity is right as the way it is.

When you reach this internal state of awareness, you realise that being in simple one pointed meditation you begin to live as your best self, the one that truly resembles everything you could have ever wanted. The thing is we don't always realise what we really mean when we want to 'awaken'. It might mean that we become so playful that we feel vulnerable because others cant appreciate the young piece of light you are inside. You may know the right thing for someone to hear but they might.

Sometimes the best thing you can do is not the thing you are willing to do. It may bring up so many fears around it.

You ask the Universe to please upgrade you to be more compassionate and loving and forgiving, and to bring you those experiences what will make you succesful, that will get you to the next level.

Maybe we don't realise that we are asking for situations where we believe we need to learn through hardship, that love is hard, that no matter what I do I will fail. We will create situations that will give us the chance to step up, and they can be many if we move fast. You will hang out with someone that challenges you in some way. You may find everyday issues that will test your resilience, your dedication. This will all be so at every moment when they ocurr you are choosing to react with the most loving reaction or a fearful one.

How much of a loving reaction am I willing to give right now?

What is my most loving reaction in this situation?

What can I do now that makes this situation the best possible for me right now?

How would it be to be free of every fear that prevents us from following the best loving choice for us right now?

What does it take to make these changes permanently and how do I do it?

The universe has a cosmic mission for us, something greater, is why it has decided to place us where we are with the start stats that it gave us, in the part of the universe where we are, to keep the balance of the universe into growing or contracting, becoming an apple from a tree with the consciousness power.

You happen to have your conscious focus into this life now

You are learning to switch between the real you and the one that lives on this Earth. 

The real you is the child like that has the ability to see another world from the apparent reality. That is our true manifestation power. Kids are naturally in Theta state, so we can use this to open up.

How much can we open to being this vulnerable to becoming the love that we are capable of being?

The most loving response goes about what we want to be given the situation given to us by the universe. 

We don't have to be perfect, but we will live better if we release all beliefs that may go with what we do

Note to author: 

scratching ourselves for pleasure keeps feeling like realising the truth of the universe, there is some self indulgence there. it's like I don't care because I know this is not real anyway. By realising this is a dream, you may believe that something does not in fact harm you.

How much you believe in that will clash with what the collective belief is. That does not mean you can't impose that reality for you. You may manage to manifest that life for yourself. You may indeed eat something toxic and not get poisoned by it {insert spiritual group that drank poison on ecstasy and did not die}. This means that what you truly belief may have an impact to even not get poisoned in front of poison. That is the same energy that will manifest money in your life, the right people, and the right situation for you to grow. It's your essence, the universal intelligence.

How much you intend during your day vs allowing an idle state, in which your subconscious will continue thinking under your conscious layer. The more you practice the virtues, the more positive your subconscious will be. The life you desire is in fact possible and probable. With the right tools and mindset you may unlock the true potential of the Quantum Field Being you are.

Breathing is key to reaching higher states of meditation and enlightenment, and to make them remain for longer.

You could in theory eat 31 days of McDonald's and feel healthier, if you truly believe that you and your intelligence may manifest that. That's a very extreme example, but it is the same as drinking poison while on states of ecstasy and not get sick. 

Teach you how to astral project so you can discover the world you make up with your thoughts and every other thing in the universe creates.
