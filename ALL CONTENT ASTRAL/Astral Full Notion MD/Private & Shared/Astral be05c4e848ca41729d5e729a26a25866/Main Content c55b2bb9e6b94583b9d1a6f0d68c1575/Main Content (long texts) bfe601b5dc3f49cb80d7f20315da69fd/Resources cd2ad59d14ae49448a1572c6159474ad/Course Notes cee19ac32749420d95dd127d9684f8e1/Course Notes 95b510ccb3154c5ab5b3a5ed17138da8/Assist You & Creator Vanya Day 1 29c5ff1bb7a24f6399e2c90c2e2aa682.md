# Theory

- Survival
    - Always trying to protect you, keeping you safe. It has a danger alert.
        - Don't do that because this will happen. You will be killed. I don't want relationship because it always goes bad.
    - To Access Survival → Where did this feeling first start?
        - Example → stepmom selling dads home after death without telling daughter. 'People always take away from me'
- Undercurrent
    - Neither good nor bad. Problem solving of the past. Shadow part, interesting agenda to do things.
        - Example → I've got to solve my problem of being beaten up. So she went to become security guard to protect herself.
        - Example → Problem solve to avoid going date to extend a divorce for a long time. Funky ways to resolve an issue
        - Revenge, anger, it has to happen this way. Create some weird justice for me to create resolution. Example →wanting to kill your sister because of having spread your mums ashes without your permission, skipping a rite of passage for others who had a say on it. Killing her so she can suffer as I did so that way it's ok.
    - To Access Undercurrent → What do you get out of this?
- Ego
    - Neither good nor bad. Our identity. Who I am. How I dress. Who I am in the world.
        - I need to dress better to fit in. I can't do this or others will think bad about me.
    - To Access Ego → How does this affect you? (In what ways your identity gets affected?)
        - Example → Stepmom selling house. I am his daughter, I have some rights. I am dismissed.
    - Gods have Ego, IT'S NOT BAD
- Higher Self
    - Really beautiul energy. Deeply connected to Energy of All That Is. Role is learning and acquiring virtues. 5th Plane Ascended Masters have mastered all virtues.
    - To Access Higher Self → What are you learning out of this?
- Creator
    - To Access Creator → What does Creator want you to learn?

- Soul
    - Core - all beliefs levels from that human life
    - Rest of existence in all dimensions times and forms
    - Soul Ego Level from separated state and grow until ascended mastery with all virtues
    - Awakened soul

# Notes

- First Answer might not be Creators
- Would Creator tell me this? Is that what the Creator would answer?
- If there is negative, is not Creator. If it talks about something definite, it's probably another of your voices.
- If there are rewards by actions, probably not the Creator.
- Energy of Higher Self is motivated by Virtues
- Undercurrent will try to solve stuff from the past and will need your conscious mind to do it. Find the true motivation.
- Creator is most Love and Truth. Pull you out of the space that is about yourself.
- When you get an answer, go higher and highger.
- What's my survival bottom belief is about love issues? or abundance issues? what does my undercurrent say about it? and my ego? and my higher self?
