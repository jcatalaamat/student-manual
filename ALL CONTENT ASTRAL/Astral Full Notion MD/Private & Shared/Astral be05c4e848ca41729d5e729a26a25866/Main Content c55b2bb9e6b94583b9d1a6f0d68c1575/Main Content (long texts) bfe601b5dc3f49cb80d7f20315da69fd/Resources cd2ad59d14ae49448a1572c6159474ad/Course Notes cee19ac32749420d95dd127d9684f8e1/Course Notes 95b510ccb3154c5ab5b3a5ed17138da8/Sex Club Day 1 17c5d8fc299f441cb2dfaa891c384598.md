- Closed group so we can know each other more instead of standalone
- Truth / Love / Sex
- Love of the Truth
    - Committed to telling the truth
    - Assume other people should know
    - What do you expect your partners to mindread about you - have you commassume others
- I really like you, and before this goes any further... I want you to know... nightmare in sex, romantic, living, shadow stuff, make believe fun  - really detailes in which you destroy or difficult
    - thanks, and if that happens, what is it that you need?
- What is the cost of not telling the truth? - where have you not been truthful or what you have not been truthful, in sex? when i felt the call for truth and didnt respond?
