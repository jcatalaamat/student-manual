# Patterns to check

- When something doesn't go right or specifically as I thought it could → I start looking for everything I did wrong and what could I have done better, or when I should have left, or how I did lie, or how I am a farse → this is from Regina healing where I struggled to find the bottom belief or I didn't get what was happening with her muscle testing. maybe she couldnt test and I took it as if I was doing something wrong myself or couldnt find the right thing. Maybe she didnt know what the thing was, she even said that. But I left feeling so self doubting of myself, untrusting myself, my abilities, what am I beyond this? Why do I keep putting things in front to challenge my healing abilities or make it difficult? what if I could just know the belief straight away and make the healing fast?
- Theres a part of me that says 'that's it' during healing or witness but not sure if it's true or wants to finish early → why not trust it? → too good , too easy,
- Sending a message and closing the app straight away → scared of the answer? the reaction? not wanting to see the truth?
- receiving a message and not wanting to read it till 'ready' etc
- Some I wanna listen, some I dont wanna listen → do I really add chocolate butter to muesli or no? I assume yeah, whilst others I have listened, like its my non negotiable
- Why do I keep distrusting myself? Had a great higher self reading, but i didnt feel like I did a great ancestor reading, my hand shaked and wanted to do stuff and I didnt allow it. It probably wanted to embody and speak thru me and I didnt let it. → looking like a fool, what if I say something wrong and then they ruin my name!!!
- Why do I keep looking to myself in camera?
- I know how to make a relationship succeed
- Authority is God

Follow your heart, be yourself, be strong, there is love but lack of understanding. They love you but they know you have your own things
