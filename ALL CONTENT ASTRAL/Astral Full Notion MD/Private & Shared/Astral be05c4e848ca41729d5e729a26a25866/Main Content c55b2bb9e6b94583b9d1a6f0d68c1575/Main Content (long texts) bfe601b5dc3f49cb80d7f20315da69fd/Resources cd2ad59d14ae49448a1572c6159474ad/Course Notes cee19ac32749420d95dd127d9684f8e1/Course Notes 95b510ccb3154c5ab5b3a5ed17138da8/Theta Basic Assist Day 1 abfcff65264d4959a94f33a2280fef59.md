# Learnings

- Beautiful to see students goals when they join a Theta Healing training.
- Thoughts → Emotions → Reality
- What you say manifests all the time. Swear very little a week. Complaints manifest. You program other people very easily. What do you say to relations when you are upset? Those are strong programmings.
- Clairsentience, clairvoyance, clairaudience, claircognizance
- Soul star - higher crown - heart of god, earth star - heart of mother earth
- Light up the light from the head down and the areas that not light up are areas with issues
- Energy breaks, shower of light

- Healing does not have to be complicated. Vianna healed her cancer with the simple 'creator heal this'
- Pull beliefs on all levels
- I love myself 'in any level' and 'in any language'.
- Flash for the Core (front of head), Flash for the soul (heart), flash for the genetic (centre of the brain), flash for the history (auric field)
- Book ⇒ Molecules of Emotion
- Ask Creator what to change belief work

# Teaching Notes

- No massive decisions during the course
- One issue
- One thing if I worked on would give me the greatest growth and healing?
- Talking lovingly about your teachers.
- Free Will, Free Agency, humans have the power to make their own choices.
- Who they are, what they want and what they are ready for - Theta Healing for dating and friendships
- Know, feel, sense it's done. If you can close your eyes and see your front door, that is visualization. Witness the changes in every area of their life and 4 levels of belief.
- You're not saving the person, you're awakening the person. People can take care of themselves. See them as master ascended masters, yo uplift them. They don't need to be saved, they need to reconnect to their higher power. God is the Healer, you are the Witness.
- Feel that is done, or you know that is finished, or you see that is finished, or you hear that is finished. How would I know that is finished? Depending on your stronger senses, but how would you know it's done?
- After 7yo the child needs to give consent, before the parents need to give consent.
- When someone says what they cannot or don't know how to do, ask would you like to know how to? What it is and how it feels like? Would you like to know how to get better? That your marriage can heal?
- Sending Unconditional Love - Intention - Witness - Feel good - Explosions in the cells like universe being born - Be creative on how to witness

# Actions

- My income, health, and loving relationships are constantly improving.

# Ideas

- During this Basic Assistant I was overlooking myself as a student. When I asked to do a Kundalini awakening, me as an assistant was supporting me as I had that strong kundalini awakening in the warehouse. I was with the whole of the London lockdown before Glastonbury being supported by myself as an assistant in these trainings.
- It was me who was telling me to meet in some times to connect and receive information. Me who told myself why and how to continue with Tinto and why to accept what they said.

# Intentions or Goals for This Course

To master the basics of Theta Healing. to learn how to teach and how to perform my own group sessions or live videos. To increase my confidence in my own abilities to do this work. To be happier and more trusting after the course. To find love. To massively increase my connection with God. To differentiate the voices in my head between Creator, Angels, Higher Self, Future Self, Lower Self instantly, confidently and trusting it. To release any belief that some of this work is hard, and make it as easy as Basic was when I was a student. To have the curiosity and interest for self transformation as I had when I first joined Basic, so I experiment often and I feel the transformation happening as I did after my Basic. To assist perfectly and deliver the healings that students need if I ever need to participate in a healing. To bring people their quantum jumps if they need me to take part on their transformation. To find clients or students in this training. To lovingly connect with students from the course. To make the future readings and angel readings easy as they used to be when I first did Basic.
