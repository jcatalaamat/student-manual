Created: November 20, 2020 6:02 AM
Abundant: No

# Patterns to check

- I'm scared of spirits, no
- It's safe to connect with any spirit
- When strong psychic I feel is best to hold breath out to the bottom, it feels 'right'
- I am debt free
- Work about Marcos
- Spanish people are evil
- Why are people ghosting me - what is it in for me - why do I connect with these on the first place

# Learnings

- Baby in the womb. Sometimes they didn't love each other the best way when they got pregnant. Send love compassion etc to the womb, enveloping the baby, visualize the soul coming in at that time with more love. Then release negative energy of doubt, unwanted, abuse, etc, that was present in the conception and embryo growth. What happened in the womb may follow you all life. Abundance, suicidal, hopes, etc. Things were going around the womb may affect the whole life. Have fathers and mothers love from around at the moment of womb, giving birth, etc
- Accept pain as joy to survive
- Free floating memories
- Subliminal ads
- Outdated info that doesn't serve me
- Anything else wants to be released now, memories, experiences, etc
- High self - closest to divine - aware of lessons - help us evolve into our virtues - purest - deeply connected to who we are right now and also energy of all that is → star, diamond over the head
    - Sometimes unaware the struggles of the human
    - master all virtues, so sometimes might remain on lessons it knows,
    - maybe its not patience anymore, but courage, so push for another virtue instead of the ones you've worked on before
    - higher self is evolving
- Sparkly shower - instead of golden shower
- Osmosis would be like triggering someone into some process because of who you are or what you do → connecting to theta thru osmosis
- Intuitive drawing in cafes
- Committed to shifting yourself, developing intuition
- Color by different means
- Study frequences
- Show me this figure, color and freqneucy
    - Show me what the liver feels like
    - Show me what healthy kidneys look like
    - Show me what archange micheal feels like
