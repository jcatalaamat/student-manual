# Routine

- I have kept my word to myself
- Thank you God for giving me my life and for allowing me to experience the joy of life. I thank you for my parents, my grandparents, my sister and my ancestors.
- Thank you for the soil beneath our feet that is the container of our experiences here on Earth. I pray for everyone to find peace in their life and love for themselves. I thank you for waking me up to the beyond of what the universe is. For allowing me to grow and expand every moment of my life.
- I release whatever comes to mind to be released for 1 hour. I do 'proper' self digging into anything that creator tells me to.
