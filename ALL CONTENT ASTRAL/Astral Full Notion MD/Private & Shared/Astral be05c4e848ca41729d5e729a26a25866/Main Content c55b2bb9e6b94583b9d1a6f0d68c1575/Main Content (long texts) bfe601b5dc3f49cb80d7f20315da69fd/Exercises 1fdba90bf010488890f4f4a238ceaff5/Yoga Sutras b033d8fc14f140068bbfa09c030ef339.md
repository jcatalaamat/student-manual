1. Now the exposition of Yoga is being made
2. The restraint of the modifications of the mind-stuff is Yoga
3. Then the Seer (Self) abides in Its own nature
4. At other times [the Self appears to] assume the forms of the mental modifications
5. There are five kinds of mental modifications which are either painful or painless
6. They are right knowledge, misconception, verbal delusion, sleep and memory
7. The sources of right knowledge are direct perception, inference and scriptural testimony
8. Misconception occurs when knowledge of something is not based upon its true form
9. An image that arises on hearing mere words without any reality [as its basis] is verbal delusion
10. That mental modification supported by cognition of nothingness is sleep
11. When a mental modification of an object previously experienced and not forgotten comes back to consciousness, that is memory
12. These mental modifications are restrained by practice and non-attachment
13. Of these two, effort toward steadiness of mind is practice
14. Practice becomes firmly grounded when well attended to for a long time, without break and in all earnestness
15. The consciousness of self-mastery in one who is free from craving from objects seen or heard about is non-attachment
16. When there is non-thirst for even the guṇas (constituents of Nature) due to the realization of the Puruṣa (True Self), that is supreme non-attachment
17. Saṁprajñāta samādhi is accompanied by reasoning, reflecting, rejoicing and pure I-am-ness
18. By the firmly convinced practice of the complete cessation of the mental modifications, the impressions only remain. This is the other samādhi [asaṁprajñāta samādhi]
19. Those who merely leave their physical bodies and attain the state of celestial deities, or those who get merged in Nature, have rebirth
    1. That’s why even the gods have to become human beings. It is only on the human level that there is a possibility of getting liberation
20. For the others, this asaṁprajñāta samādhi could come through faith, vigor, memory, contemplation and/or by discernment
21. To the keen and intent practitioner this [samādhi] comes very quickly
22. The time necessary for success further depends on whether the practice is mild, medium or intense
23. Or [samādhi is attained] by devotion with total dedication to Īśvara
    1. This is where Echart Tolle and Mooji speak about dropping into it. Just drop it, let it all go, sudden realisation of who you are by devotion and connection to it.
24. Īśvara is the supreme Puruṣa, unaffected by any afflictions, actions, fruits of actions or by any inner impressions of desires
25. In Īśvara is the complete manifestation of the seed of omniscience
26. Unconditioned by time, Īśvara is the teacher of even the most ancient teachers
    1. I am that I am
    2. I am Thine; all is Thine; Thy will be done
    3. I get out of the way
27. The word expressive of Īśvara is the mystic sound OM
28. To repeat it with reflection upon its meaning is an aid
29. From this practice all the obstacles disappear and simultaneously dawns knowledge of the inner Self
30. Disease, dullness, doubt, carelessness, laziness, sensuality, false perception, failure to reach firm ground and slipping from the ground gained—these distractions of the mind-stuff are the obstacles
31. Accompaniments to the mental distractions include distress, despair, trembling of the body and disturbed breathing
32. The practice of concentration on a single subject [or the use of one technique] is the best way to prevent the obstacles and their accompaniments
33. By cultivating attitudes of friendliness toward the happy, compassion for the unhappy, delight in the virtuous and disregard toward the wicked, the mind-stuff retains its undisturbed calmness
34. Or that calm is retained by the controlled exhalation or retention of the breath
35. Or the concentration on subtle sense perceptions can cause steadiness of mind
36. Or by concentrating on the supreme, ever-blissful Light within
37. Or by concentrating on a great soul’s mind which is totally freed from attachment to sense objects.
38. Or by concentrating on an experience had during dream or deep sleep.
39. Or by meditating on anything one chooses that is elevating.
40. Gradually, one’s mastery in concentration extends from the primal atom to the greatest magnitude.
41. Just as the naturally pure crystal assumes shapes and colors of objects placed near it, so the yogi’s mind, with its totally weakened modifications, becomes clear and balanced and attains the state devoid of differentiation between knower, knowable and knowledge. This culmination of meditation is samādhi.
42. The samādhi in which name, form and knowledge of them is mixed is called savitarkā samādhi, or samādhi with deliberation.
43. When the memory is well purified, the knowledge of the object of concentration shines alone, devoid of the distinction of name and quality. This is nirvitarkā samādhi, or samādhi without deliberation.
44. In the same way, both savicārā (reflective) and nirvicārā (super or non-reflective) samādhi, which are practiced upon subtle objects, are explained.
45. The subtlety of possible objects of concentration ends only at the undefinable.
46. Each of the above kinds of samādhi are sabīja (with seed), which could bring one back into bondage or mental disturbance.
47. In the purity of nirvicārā samādhi, the supreme Self shines.
48. This is ṛtambharā prajñā, or the absolute true consciousness.
49. This special truth is totally different from knowledge gained by hearing, study of scripture or inference.
50. The impression produced by this samādhi wipes out all other impressions.
51. When even this impression is wiped out, every impression is totally wiped out and there is nirbīja [seedless] samādhi.
