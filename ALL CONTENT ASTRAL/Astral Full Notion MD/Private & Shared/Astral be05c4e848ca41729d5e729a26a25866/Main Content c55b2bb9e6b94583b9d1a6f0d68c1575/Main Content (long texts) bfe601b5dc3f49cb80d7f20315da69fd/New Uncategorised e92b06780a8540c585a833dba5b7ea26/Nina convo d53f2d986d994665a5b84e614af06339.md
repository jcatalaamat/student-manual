No: No
Yes: No

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 22:57:56]:

isnt it all divine intervention?

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 22:57:57]:

so some of us are blessed from birth

and other doomed for eternity?

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 22:58:12]:

so here

you compare their lives to ours

and their happiness to your happiness

as if it had to be any different

you woke up, you worked on yourself, you let go of the past - awesome

they don't - awesome

I mean, aren't we blessed from being born now and not in 2nd world war?

arent we blessed not to be born in the US?

or africa?

i mean

we're privileged

what are we going to do with it

since we're the ones who can act

like in an argument - the first one to see can guide the other one to see

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:00:17]:

yes that is the right questuon

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:00:19]:

the one who doesnt see doesnt

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:00:35]:

What are we going to do with it, since we are the one who can act

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:00:44]:

thank you üôÇ

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:00:48]:

that what makes me wake up in the morning

You know what, I react so strongly because i am terrified I fear that you would never shift that energy and that you would stay resentful from your childhood, upset about life and that i will suffer enormously from it

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:01:21]:

yes you fear i would become your dad üòÑ

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:01:24]:

yes

omg

its so painful

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:01:51]:

and this like anything else is something we can shift together

and not separate

both at the same time

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:02:16]:

how can I do if you dont trust my ways ?

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:02:28]:

because i can't shift as long as you can't let it go

so you're the one who is angry at your dad and can't cccept what was

and blame them for their non choices

and cant forgive

nor accept

that some people cant change

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:03:02]:

I accept, but i cant have it in my life

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:03:08]:

or with the tools they had they could not face changing

stop that

dush

every time

'cant have it in my life'

its your own fear speaking

'cant stand this'

is your own fear

that you're going to get it

if you put your guard down

and that does not allow yout o be free

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:03:49]:

Yes !! but that is true !!

if you live with someone depressed 5 years, how do you think you gonna feel in the end??

And with a drug addict, or an alchoolic ??

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:04:34]:

that is a total manipulationof the conversation and I am not pleased you cant answer that question as you type it

you can have boundaries and leave

not my fault your parents were perfect to create a spiral of shit

not so unlike mine

i am depressed

you buy into my depression

is both of our patterns here!

like a big 777 money

like abuse-victim

you cant be abused wherever you dont find yourself a victim

it simply does not work

energy cant touch you that way

there's no receptors for it

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:06:23]:

so you tell me ; some people never change, and thats perfect, all you can do is leave, with an open heart

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:06:35]:

no, what you do, is you opn the heart

if with an open heart is time to leave, you leave

opening the heart, more often than not, is going thru your own shit, fears, and recovering your voice and power and willingness to communicate peacefully, so NOT A BIG DEAL

'i open my heart' -> yes SURE

thank you im having fun with the conversation

opening the heart

simple sentence

huge reminiscences

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:08:16]:

so you open the heart when you choose to be upset about life ?

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:08:28]:

are you turning this against me now?

I was going thru my feelings

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:08:40]:

no, no sorry

thats not it

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:08:48]:

which actually eventually allowed me to cry

which was opening the heart yes

sometimes it is like that

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:09:01]:

It was not my intention

ok

i sart to get it

start

i see exactly where is my fear

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:09:38]:

sometimes like with karlyn, expressing the negative belief allows that unexpressed frozen part of us to feel free

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:09:42]:

sorry I am coming back in a few minutes

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:09:47]:

ok

kiss love

look, If I had pulled myself out of the shit by taking action, I wouldnt be so wise now

and I only had this realisation now hahaha üòú

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:15:41]:

Thank you for hanling my anger so good

Iahha

Your my biggest teacher

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:16:06]:

I feel we're on the next league now üôÇ

I am looking forward to tell you some stuff for you to feel proud üôÇ

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:16:40]:

I FEEL SO PROUD ANYWAY

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:16:45]:

I can see them like the bullets that they shoot to NEo

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:17:17]:

I am discussing views and resistances, I see how freakin amazing you are

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:17:38]:

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:18:47]:

yepppp

Jee Ka, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:19:09]:

I am still becoming more everyday

I feel when I am tensed up

it's got much better

I have been humbled by the universe

and at the same time i see more of my own value

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:19:47]:

I¬† so exciited to see you tommorowwwwww

Nina Moore, [21 Oct 2021 at 23:20:01]:
