# Intention

- Facing trauma with their partner
- Not only healing oneself
- What we can transcend in 2 we can transcend in the whole
    - Partnership is a doorway to being able to reconnect to the unity consciousness in the world
    - Change the way we relate as society
- Key for a new Era
    - Doorway to remembrance of symbiosis as how to be as a collective
    - synchrony with partner = synchrony with the universe
- Introduce how to do clearings in couples → how to be a mirror of truth → how to trust the other → how to surrender → foundation training
    - Fear of control → full surrender to the other one as a representation of god → you as a god → 2 copies of the same → living in the edge of each other's paradise
        - you serve me as you are being and I serve you as I am being and no one feels like is serving the other, they are only being
- debunking
    - toxic relationships → good or bad type of relationships
    - when we play out trauma is an opportunity to transform, not to run away
    - the clash is there to teach us, so we need the tools and know the process
    - it takes too much time
    - if i love here i am going to be abused → ego constructs
    - loose my life, giving my life away to the relationship
    - there is a right person for me and i don't choose the right person
        - keep picking the same wrong person because we keep reproducing the same issue
        - each relationship is for a learning, there are no skipping lessons, if one partner was good between 2 partners that were bad, it is because there was a peaceful lesson to learn and to stabilise before going back to the front line
        - everywhere where there is hardship there is growth
        - if it's time to leave a person it will be from a place of peacefulness because god has instructed you to move on, not because you react to a pain and close the heart
    - every relation is about ourselves, what we learn about ourselves
        - when we get attached to the other we lose sense of that
        - thru your lifetime you only love yourself, thru all the partners, and recovering heart break is integrating the lost one into your heart
        - heart breaks are doors to open the heart
            - when you soften after heart break is when you enlighten yourself → opening the heart to further levels → + unconditional love
            - forgiveness in relations
            - seeing the hurt of the other
                - rather than taking something as personal you first have to look at the hurt of the other → they are the victims, you have more consciousness, its your duty and responsibility to uplift the consciousness in the world
            - embody benevolence as a way to exchange energy with people
    - victim vs persecutor
        - we are all victims
        - who is more victim, the one who can't see they are hurt or the one who can show the other where they hurt?
        - we are all persecutors in many subtle and not so subtle places
        - where we don't allow others to empower themselves from victim to whole, we choose to be persecutors ourselves
        - 
    - passive aggressiveness
        - toxic & subtle → more accepted than anger → harder to distinct
        - very destructive → poison → drop by drop, rottening
        - passive aggressive people often when shown the truth they try to escape → 'Im done with this, with your anger' → even tho they are not done with their as much negative as anger expression of passive aggressiveness
    - fear of anger
        - not so fearful of grief when someone else cries, yet it also blocks us → we accept almost every emotion in others even if its sudden and intense, except anger and rage
    - Illusion of the safe distance
        - I need time for myself
        - I cant do this - Not my problem → Escaping
        - Against the new-age concept of being independent and fearing codependency → not ok to be so close and work together → fearing that closeness is a trap → dropping protection towards someone else → true ascension
- self responsibility
    - owning your experience
    - proper communication
    - not hold grudges as we keep 'swallowing'
    - failure of this often turns into
        - passive aggresivenes
        - constant triggers with anger
        - big anger accumulation and explosion
- grudges vs opening space
    - choosing to devalue myself → closing down → choose to resign the relation
    - the most loving response is up to us
    - if we are the ones awake, we take responsibility, we don't use that chance as a reason to state that the universe is here to hurt us -> we choose the reality we want to live in → we choose to open our hearts and grow → if we don't do it, who would? we expect the other one to lead us? we are the ones who have to lead ourselves, especially if we can see it
        - facing the fear of being the first one in freeing ourselves → BIG TRAUMA LOOP → leap of faith → meeting God → acting from the inside out, not the outside in
        - if we see it, we can change it ≠ if we don't see it, we can't change it → be the one who breaks the pattern, don't wait for other to break it for you, because the inside is the outside so if you are not willing then other will not either → leap of faith
- desolidifying the other → let the other one change → start anew everyday → there is no time → life begins everyday and it's now → be a constant invitation for the other to desolidify themselves
    - how we allow others to not be defined by the stories about themselves
    - I do this because I am like that
    - justifying the ego mind
    - what would have been in the past
    - self limitation by referencing to something external or past
- self responsibility to call out and be called out → allowing each other to lead us where we cannot see
    - ask for feedback
    - invite to offer feedback
- each one of us is a particular resonating medicine → we are meant to trigger each other where our triggers resemble inversely each other, so we can both clear at the same time
    - where there is no resonance there is no relating or there is neutrality
        - we are in a stage of healing, not creating, from our full potentials, humanely
    - we are not here to make each other comfortable, to challenge and to invite growth into each other
    - if we feel something more than neutrality, it's a trigger
    - if we react somehow to the other, it is a trigger for us, and we can bring light to them as that will also empower us in the position of teaching and upleveling the world → our grace will lead → it's places where we are offered to open our hearts → if there is growth in something for us and we reject it, aren't we choosing fear? → how can we defend that it has to be someone else's issue if we have the chance to educate others?
    - educate others with example → not lowering yourself to their level of consciousness
- we say its not about us, but the world is about us, and it's about us sharing what the world is for us → self responsibility and self sovereignty → [An Exchange of Presence](An%20Exchange%20of%20Presence%20f6d1c83273624fb5a7241f611233591a.md)
- life starts anew now, every second → memories are the only thing that allow us to keep track → when we live with no thinking there is only a constant change in the present moment of now
    - each moment we find a different version of ourselves in front of us
