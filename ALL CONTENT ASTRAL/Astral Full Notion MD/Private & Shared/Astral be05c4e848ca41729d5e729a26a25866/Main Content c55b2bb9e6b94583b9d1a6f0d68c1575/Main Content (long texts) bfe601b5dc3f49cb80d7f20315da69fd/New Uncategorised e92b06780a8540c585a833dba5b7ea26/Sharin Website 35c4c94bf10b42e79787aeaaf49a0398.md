Hi Sharin! 

I have had a very deep process this last month and I feel like now I can propose you for what you asked.

I have prepared a breakdown of how I would see working on the website

- Included
    - Main page + secondary page + e-shop page
    - Basic SEO
    - Wordpress building plugin, + hosting + backups
    - Meetings about text, design, structure, etc
    - 2 drafts before publishing
    - 5 changes after publishing
        - A change is enough work that is worthy to go into the website and make some changes. It would be like some texts and images to be updated, or addition of new sections. The idea is that we compress the work in batches, so the context switching is less.
- Not Included
    - Yearly hosting + backups
    - Extra changes
    - New pages
    - Hiring a professional SEO developer

When I tune into the energy of the project I feel that is best to deliver the whole project at once rather than breaking it down on stages. 

The positive is that Nina and I have both been in your retreats, both for Medicine of Love and Mystery School, and I have also done private 1 to 1 work with you. We understand the vision and the offerings, so it is great that we can tap into that energy and channel what would best fit the project.

The price has been felt given the energy project as a whole. My commitment would be to make a great website that would stand as unique, and to give you peace of mind that the work would be of high standard and that you would be pleased with the result. An honest exchange that would allow me to thrive and to give 100% of me and to make sure that  project unfolds effortlessly would be of 4000€. 

There are some factors that may affect the estimated quote, which are regarding to the specific offerings you are to show (I did not understand if you are looking to add the Medicine of Love retreat besides the Mystery School or any other offering like the mentorship or kambo, etc) and the functionality you expect the website to include, like automation tools for lead managing, bookings or calendars, etc (which would make future admin easier, but not required).

I have considered this price tuning into two possible options, which are for the main page + the soft page + the shop, OR the main page + 2 soft pages. This does not mean that clarification on this may inflate the price, but rather give an attunement on the energy of the project and feeling into the right exchange. I am including some questions to further exploring this.

Informations 

- Main Information
    - What information is going to go to the main page?
    - What other pages you need and what is their content?
    - What are all the offerings you are planning on putting up?
    - Can people book and/or pay retreats or services directly through the website? Or will they contact you and manage that away from the website?
    - What are the Call To Action (CTA) that people can take
- E-shop
    - Can people pay directly through the shop, with a cart, or are they going to contact you to make an order and pay separately?
    - The shop can have extra functionality to admin easier, including cart not only for products but also for events, retreats, and services. These are paid plugins from the e-commerce platform we would be using. This would depend on what your previous answers are.
- Admin
    - Do you have the copy (text), images, and catchphrases ready?
    - Do you have a skeleton of the structure of the information?
    - Are there any websites you know of you resonate either fully or partially (sections) with re design or concept?
    - Do you have a mood board and/or a colour palette you resonate with?

# Price

- 4000€
    - main page (2500) + extra page (500) + shop (1000)
    - 2 drafts before final publishing included
    - after publishing, 5 changes (worth 750)
        - try to accumulate enough work so it's worth for me to go in to change
        - (a change is a minimal amount of work that need changing in the website, updating, etc, like changing a text or image) → 1 change = 1 full batch to change
            - changing image, text, moving something somewhere else, adding a section, etc.
    - meetings about design & text (worth ++)
    - paid plugin (25) + hosting (75) + backups included (50) (after, 150 per year)
    - seo partially included (included)
        - can hire someone to work on that (300)
- after that, plugin + hosting + backup is 150 per year
- after that, each change is 150€
- after that, a new secondary page like the first one's is 750€ initial + consecutive 500€
