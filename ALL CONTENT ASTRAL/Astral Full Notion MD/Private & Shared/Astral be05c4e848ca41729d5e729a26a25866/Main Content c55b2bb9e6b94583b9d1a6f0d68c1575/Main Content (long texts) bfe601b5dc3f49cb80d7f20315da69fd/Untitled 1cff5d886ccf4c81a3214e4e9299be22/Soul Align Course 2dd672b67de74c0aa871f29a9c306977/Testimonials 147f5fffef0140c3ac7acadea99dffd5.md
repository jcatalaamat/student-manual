# Testimonials

# Holly

*The healings I went through with Jee were deep and transformative. Through his practice, he is able to prise issues from the mind and release them through the heart.*

*His compassion and belief allows vulnerability in the unknown, acceptance of ugly realities and enables you to rise above blocks we accumulate along with our lives. He showed me how to love myself, that experience is strength, and our power runs further than this body.*

*I will be recommending Jee to anyone who wants to heal recurring problems, limitations or unexplained sadness.*

# Blanka

*We worked on some very old mindsets and beliefs. One of the most blocking beliefs was the feeling of not being (good) enough.*
