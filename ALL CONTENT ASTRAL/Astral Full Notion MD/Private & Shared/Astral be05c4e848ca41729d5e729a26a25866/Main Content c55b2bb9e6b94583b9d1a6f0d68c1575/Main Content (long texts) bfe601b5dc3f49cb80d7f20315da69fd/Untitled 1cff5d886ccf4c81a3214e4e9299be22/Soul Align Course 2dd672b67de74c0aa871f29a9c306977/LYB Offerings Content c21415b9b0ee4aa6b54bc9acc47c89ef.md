# Groups

There are two types of group sessions

- Clearing Sessions. I scan the participants and proceed with energy clearing that is most needed.
- Group Digging. The participants that would like to receive a healing on their particular topic in front of the class can volunteer for this during the opening of the session, and the most appropriate person to work with will be chosen. Plenty of times different life stories require the same sort of healing, so most the time this is applicable.

# Testimonials game

Meet Anna,

Anna has been struggling with this and that, she has tried different things but it always comes back, and meditation and yoga didn't solve it. She knows what she wants to shift but it always takes so much time. A bit more drama. 

She speaks with a friend that knows Nirmana, and after an Introduction Call, discussing situation and intentions, she gets a session booked in with Jordi.

They meet in Zoom for 75min. 

A typical session consists of a topic subject, what is the challenge or focus. From there we go into Theta, a very relaxed conscious state of trance, and we have a conversation. When we find the root cause of a pattern that we want to shift, we witness the healing by the energy of Source and we complement it with installing energy receptors that upgrade our human software.

We use a form of applied kinesiology, which show us the truth about what our subconscious believes to be true. With this we can acknowledge the underlaying programming that is running our life (we spend 80% of time in auto mode with our subconscious) so we can muscle test and have a tangible proof that a belief change has taken place.

Could talk about the muscle test example or sth

Anna feels peaceful and relaxed at the end of the session, much lighter and ready for what is to come.

# What is Theta Healing

Theta Healing is a form of Energy Healing, using the Theta brainwave state, that connects us to the subconscious mind, and allows us to find and replace limiting beliefs and replace them for empowering ones. With simple applied kinesiology we can easily confirm aspects of us that may not serve us and command the healing to take place. We do this from the 7th Plane, energy of Pure Consciousness, Source, the Universe. Sessions often end with a very peaceful and calm state, and other times with lots of joy and excitement.

# About Nirmana

Nirmana means in Sanskrit, Transformation through Manifestation. Transformation is the adjective that defines the proactive act of becoming that which is whoever you are meant to be 100%. Without all the other conditioning and imprints that have been projected. Manifestation is the art of allowing the Universe to bring you that which you desire and is aligned with your soul. We intent change to happen by accessing the subconscious in Theta state and we witness and acknowledge the healing taking place, all by the energy of Pure Consciousness or Source.

My goal is to provide others with the opportunities of what energy healing can provide into people's lives, realising the value and the impact it has made on my own experience. Deep permanent change into empowerment.

# Pro-Rata and Free Sessions

# Other Practices

I have trained in a number of different arts. From Software Engineer for over 8 years to Men's Leadership, Love, Intimacy & Polarity, over 600h of Yoga Teachers Training, Laughter Yoga, Mindfulness, Thai Massage, Reiki, Access Bars.

Theta Healing is the tool that I use the most and feel most comfortable with. The rest of the toolkit provides me with overall perspective and awareness of the all encompassing.

# Spiritual Coaching

I had my first adult awakening in 2016. I realised there was something not right and for the first time I had the awareness to recognise and decide to do different.

Career wise I was very successful. I had moved to London from Barcelona, worked in successful companies as a Software Engineer like PwC, and startups like Movebubble, Just Auto Insurance, and Tinto Motherhood. I had a great life work balance, being a remote worker and being able to perform from anywhere. I even became CTO for some months.

If it all had actually been aligned with my soul's purpose. Instead of programming a software I reprogram my human existence. Spent so many hours looking for what we call software bugs, and then reengineering a better more optimum solution bug-free. I feel very similarly with Energy Healing. Instead of treating the effect we go, find the cause and become free of it.

I have gone through all many stages in my spiritual awakening. Depression, anger, confusion, lack of purpose, meditation jerks and twitches, kundalini releases, enlightenment glimpses.

Now I have found what I was looking for and when I don't know I know how to find out about it. Universal Consciousness, the Akashic Records.
