# Social Marketing Theta

- Question: what shall I do with my current IG? Totally transform it into Healing? Mix Healing + Hiking? Is that serious? Is that right energy? Create new IG?
- What do you want to be? Thought Leader? Expert? My message? Just start...? Just 1on1 clients? 10k followers? 100ppl group meeting? 1000 people zoom meeting?
- Blessing content at scheduling, placing intention
- The 4 intentions Exercise:
- Do you like writing? focus on writing. Or videos? Or speaking? How do you deliver the content? Podcast?
- Check IGs of who you ike that relate to you
- Reach out to ppl with podcast and work with them
- It has to bring you joy as you make it
- Schedule time to create content and schedule, weekly, biweekly, monthly? how often you will post? Commit and accountability
