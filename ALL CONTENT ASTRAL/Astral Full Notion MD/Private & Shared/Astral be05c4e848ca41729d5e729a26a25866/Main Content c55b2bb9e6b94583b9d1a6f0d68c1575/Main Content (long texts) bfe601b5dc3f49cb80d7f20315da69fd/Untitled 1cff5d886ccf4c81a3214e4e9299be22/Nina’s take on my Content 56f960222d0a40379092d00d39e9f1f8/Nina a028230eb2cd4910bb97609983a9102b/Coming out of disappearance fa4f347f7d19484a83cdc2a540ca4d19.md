# Coming out of disappearance

Description: life experience

A year has passed since I pulled away from my social life. I pulled away from many of the relationships I thought I cared about.

Note the word 'thought' as thoughts are Ego-mind. The Ego 'thinks', the Heart 'feels'.

If we are talking about reconnecting to our hearts we need to be speak from our hearts. If the words that we choose create the reality we live in, then whenever we speak from a thought we speak from the limitations of the Ego-mind.

If we are to change our lives and to change truly for the 'better', or let's say to 'become more of ourselves and of our true selves', then we have to begin taking responsibility for all the unconscious choices we make.

Go back to the basics.

Everything is made of energy, everything is connected to everything that has been in contact with, the connection between particles that were once one and now are many is faster than light.

All matter is composed of the same materials, and the difference between one object and another is its frequency (or vibrational speed) and its structure.

Thoughts are things. Thoughts are powerful things. Use them with respect. Thoughts are tools.

What you bring into your mind exists in a different vibration (thoughts are energy vibrating at a different frequency). All of your possible futures already exist, simultaneously and parallelly from each other, and they change constantly as you change.

Your becoming is about aligning yourself to the timeline that you truly wish to be and is the easiest, transformative, fun, exciting and fulfilling of all of the possible, which already exist and you already lived. It's about re-aligning at every moment with yourself, with the most updated Truth of who you are.

Like a clockmaker, where the subtleties of you become the gift you.

Everything that my mind thinks is Ego, as thinking pulls us away from HERE & NOW. If you present, you will find yourself being in action, which means that you find yourself being that which is acting. If you are acting it, it is true at that moment for you. If you are not, then your mind is going to project fears about why you should or should not do it. If you become present again, the thoughts leave, and you are the action or non-action.

~~You could have the same object in different frequencies and these two would live in a different plane of existence, a different reality, a different dimension. And you could have different objects of different structures in the same plane of reality.~~

~~Actualisation is the act of making something real, and it is done by the heart. The heart feels that which your true self is meant to become and everything that comes with the act of being. You focus on the feelings that you would feel if you would already be that.~~ 

~~Manifestation is the act of creating something through how it shows up. Focusing on the details  of what and how are projections and attachment of how things worked in the past and that may not be your highest good. These are both lead by the Ego-mind.~~
