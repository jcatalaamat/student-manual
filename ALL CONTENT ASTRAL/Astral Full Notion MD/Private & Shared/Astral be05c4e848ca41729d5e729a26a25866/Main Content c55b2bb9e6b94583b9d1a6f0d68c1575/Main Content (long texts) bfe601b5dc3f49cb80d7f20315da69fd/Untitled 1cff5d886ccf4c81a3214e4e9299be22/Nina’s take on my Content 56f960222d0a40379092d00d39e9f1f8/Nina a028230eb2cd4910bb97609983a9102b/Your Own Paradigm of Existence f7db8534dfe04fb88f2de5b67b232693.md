# Your Own Paradigm of Existence

You change, the world changes

ðŸ’¡ The inside is a mirror to the outside - what does it mean to you

## Who Am I

Am I the owner of my life, fully responsible for the outcome of it, or am I a mere piece being swayed around by stronger energies than myself?

When you think about yourself, do you do it from a place of powerlessness or a place of empowerment?

Do you believe yourself to be the creator of your life or just a mere driver trying to fit on the roads that finds ahead? If you are the latter, if you believe that you may only go as far as others let you or allow you, then you are buying into a limiting belief. If everyone was to think the same way, then no one would be successful, no one would turn their dreams into reality. If you are the first one, then you know of the manifesting power you own and realise that every action you take and every decision you make creates the reality and the existence of who you are.

Everything outside is a reflection of the inside.

When you look outside and you judge someone else's action, you are judging the same about yourself or the lack of it. When you like something about someone else, you like the same about yourself or want the same in yourself. When you are able to see beauty in the world, you see beauty in yourself. When you can't but see pain in the world, you tune into the pain inside of yourself.

For some, life on Earth is Hell, and for some, it is Heaven. You may be in the same city and have a complete different experience to someone else. That is the inner world.

Whatever you expect to happen it will happen. Whatever you fear to happen, might happen. Whatever you desire to happen, will not happen.

## Co-Creators

We are conscious creators of our reality. Science has proved with quantum theory that everything is made of energy, or even better, light particles. All physical atoms can be split into particles of light, that behave in a way or another depending of what you are expecting the result will be. If I look for a physical particle, the same energy rearranges itself and becomes physical. If in another way, I expect to find energy, a wave, I do see the behaviour in energy, and no particle weight.

This means that when you believe something to become real, the energy will rearrange itself into becoming that which you are believing to be real. If you want to see an action as selfish, you are rearranging that reality to yourself so you may feel the negative emotions that come from it.

Does happiness belong to you or to external factors? Do you choose to be happy or you let others choose for your own happiness?

Does someone cutting you in the line makes you feel somehow? Or do you choose that because someone cuts you in the line that reminds you of how other crossed your boundaries whenever that experience first happened, making you feel like you are not being respected? And why would that, from someone you don't know, had to affect you?

Who told you that when someone does something you have to feel a certain way?

I want to be happy, either I am crossed in the line or I am not. I want to be happy, either if someone projects on me their opinion of beauty and their view of me in it.

Do I self validate myself or allow to be driven by others opinions? Do I seek validation from the outside or from the inside?

Do I love my life if others say something limiting about my life? Do I let their opinion take toll onto what I believe about myself? Who is anyone else to say anything about my life? Are they actually living it?

Do they know what it means to be me? How can they be in any position to be able to say something of any power over who I am? Am I giving away my power or am I owning that my power comes from my own self-trust?

Why do someone else's words have more importance than my own words?

My words are the most relevant words that I would need to care about. My own self-love is the most relevant love I can ever hold. Even deeper, how can I love someone else if I cannot love myself? How can I know what love is if I cannot feel it first for myself? If I don't receive my own love, then how do I really know what love feels like towards someone else's?

Wherever I cannot love someone else is where I cannot love myself, either by having or by not having that trait. By judging or by fearing. Let's say I can't stand jealous people, if my reaction is strong, then I know that I am also rigid within myself towards myself, or I am scared of the truth that I may also be like that and I don't wanna admit and work on myself to free that limiting part of me.

Ideally, emotions would be balanced. Not too high, not too low. That might sound boring, but after reaching 30, you may also have realised that you are exhausted of drama and trauma, either good or bad, and also that when you reach very huge highs, you also fall from higher. Maybe is best to remain in the centre, peaceful and balanced.

Limitations you see in others are limitations you see in yourself, or parts that you judge as limiting as you focus on the limiting side instead of the gain or why would that work. If you seek to see the good in others, that means you seek to look the good in yourself. When you see something limiting, but you seek what is the bright side of it, you know you are a positive person, always trying to see the bright side on things. Which ultimately brings you to a higher and more positive life.

Having no opinion is better than having opinion. If you judge food as negative, then others will already be suggested to expect something bad, therefor it's easier for them to tune into the idea that there is something bad, and find or create it in their plate.

How good is this food? Vs How is this food?

Have you tried this food? It's so badly cooked, it tastes awful. vs Have you tried this food? How do you find it?

Totally different energies and experiences. We seek to buy others approvals of our experiences to feel like our existence is worthy. We're hardwired to buy or reject others points of view. We can't remain neutral most of the time. We're wired to conclusions. To conclude and box anything that is happening or happened. We do this because our brain is a prediction machine and it wants to make sure that everything is under control.

If I want to see good, I will see more of the good. If I have been affected by the past and suggested about the bad, and been surrounded by people who see the bad, then I am more prone to see the perspective that is more limiting and more closed down emotionally, leaving me with less chances of seeing the good and getting out of it

Oh, you see? I knew it was going to be bad! - The person was expecting to find something limiting, and he co-created the reality into being that way, reinforcing the feeling that he was right to feel that it was going to be bad, giving some sort of security that he controls his emotions by expecting things to be bad, instead of remaining open to every situation - All men are dicks - typical expression that hurt woman use as a way of protecting themselves, not realising that by expecting to find men who fit their rule, they will manifest in their life the exact men that will fit into their image of men. That is why some people see life as Hell or as Heaven.

# My Belief is My Life

For me the most important and transformational perspective for it to be motivated and feeling capable without giving my power to any outside entity is the believe on myself.

I believe on myself that anything I believe is real * therefor I choose to believe the most motivational and exciting possible life perspective that there is for me. The ability of how much we manifest it in the physical is straightly correlated with the amount of our self belief minus the balance with the collective consciousness that effects us. If there is a contrary belief of something, its energies will polarise with ours so they might lessen the power of it. Love always beats fear so anything that is loving and aligned with your Truth, without trying to force any view that is not you, will always have the greater power over the limiting beliefs from collective consciousness.

This means that the one of the things stopping you from levitating is how much you really believe that is possible, coming from the Heart and your Ego. It will also go against the belief of many, so 'proving' it to some might just become impossible, so even if you do levitate on your own, there is a difference when someone who doesn't believe has to take part on the observation. Remember, quantum theory speaks about the observer effecting reality, to either pole, so as much as you create reality, others do too.

Belief will vary during your life, and it will unfold on its own the more you spend realising the Truths, and applying some conscious exercises when that is actually happen.

Children are the ones that belief anything and everything, the ones that still believe in magic or want to believe in magic, that they are doctors, or truck drivers, or knights. In their imagination, during the duration of that belief / story / imagination they do believe that they are and happens what they say. 

That is the most powerful manifestation moment for a being. But because they still don't understand the whole complexity of the world, they get crushed by the limiting awareness of the parents. They have effect over their reality as they live it, imagining, intuitive, and they can get really sucked in their own reality, eg imaginary friends.

Not believing in someone will limit the someone, specially if you have great manifesting power. Whatever you believe to be true yo will somehow manifest, so you will direct energy to the type of observation you are making (atoms/physical, waves/energy, from the same particles). Judging someone as anything will with a certain charge direct energy towards that, so that person will begin hearing that belief in his subconscious. He will learn it by your words, behaviour, body language, and just energy intuitively, as we're not really separate from each other.

# There Is No Separation

Science has proved that we're energy, and so there is an energy field around us. We live in a field where everything is interconnected, like a web, and so we're actually all effecting each other, just like gravity does on the whole planet and us. This field effects all and lets us imprint each other with the effect that we cause.

Let's look at some examples, like sharing a room with someone that is negative, either they will imprint us with their negativity or we will effect somehow to them with our positivity. But you don't even need to share words with the person. Haven't you been in a room and felt uncomfortable with someone? Was it a gut feeling, an intuition? That is because the field allows all these signals to travel and be understood with our energy centres (chakras). Is as if you had another sense that instead of sensing flower scent, tasted a burger, or heard a buzzing sound, you could sense, feel or know the overall mood and energy of the person. These are called psychic senses, and they come in a variety of ways relating to our physical senses.

And we could develop a whole new sense if we were to believe in it. Because you're part of the field and the field is everywhere, you can tap into anything and feel it or sense it. Practice is important and so is belief and so is not allowing your more 3D mind to get on the way by judging yourself or judging what you're trying to accomplish, everything that would actually be limiting.

If your 3 year old kid is telling you how he or she is trying to connect and hear what the tree is telling her, would you just tell her

- I believe in you, let me know what the tree has said, has the tree a message for me? I want you to explain me how you do it because daddy also wants to do it
- You're dumb the trees can't do that and you're an idiot and because you are I don't love you because that is not my reality

See the difference? This wouldn't make a child delusional, and we can't judge that this child would grow into a world believing crazy things. This is again a limiting belief from the reader. Because it would be hard to believe this and having not realised this during all our life. But for a child, they could grow into full adult and keep believing this, increasing its powers to a very high level, with a strong belief able to transform reality at its will. The adults are the limited beings, as they have grown unaware of all these which I am teaching you. The children are born ready for it, as they remain connected and pure.

Children will emotionally grow and still be able to see the collective consciousness as it works for the limitations, but they will choose the most loving path and aligned with them, which is living a more magical life, where everything you want to imagine can actually exist. Much better than saying 'the world is limited because nothing more than what is physically proved exists and I prefer to feel limited because choosing magic makes me feel vulnerable.

# Choose a Magical World

When choosing a reality you want to believe, to live in, do you prefer to choose one that motivates you and excites you or one that is limiting?

If you can choose to live with magic, would you choose to embody someone who does not believe in what motivates them most? When I was a child I used to believe that the world was anything I could imagine. Therefor my believe on it does create that reality in a certain level, as much as my belief is stronger than the other people belief.

Collective consciousness is the conscious idea that people openly believe. If you tap into this you can use the collective to support into the work that you are doing. It gives it more energy awareness as more people are tapping into that one. So the more people believe that magic exists, the more magic potential there is. The collective subconscious is the subconscious ideas and thoughts that the collective has. So in here we are speaking about the subconscious, which is 90% of people's actions and thoughts. In here you have all the unknown fears and limitations coming from limiting beliefs that live around in people's subconscious.

# Fear & Your Free Will

Choosing fear is following up the chain of projections and lack of love in your life, it is expected of you given the circumstances you have had.

Divine cosmic consciousness is an intelligence, a quantum intelligence that makes up the fabric of all that is in the universe and across dimensions, time and space. It lives outside of the boundaries of time as time does not really exist science tells us.

There is an illusion of time in the universe where things happen linear but the truth is everything is happening at the same time, past, present future, and they are all affecting each other. All things influence all things because they are all connected. This is all driven and connected to the divine intelligence that runs the universe.

You are the main and most important character in your life. Without you there is nothing. There would not be a universe for you unless there is you. In fact, you can't even prove that anything else is real besides you. You can only be sure that you exist, which makes life an adventure to bring to you all your desires come true, but only those desires that are free of all the projection that has been going on in your life. Everything is still a product of what you can perceive with your senses. You are the most important being in your own life. If you can't make yourself happy, being who you are, then you cant contribute to the world in any real way. What has happened to you it's very unfortunate, but that which seems your weekness is actually your strength. Choosing that what has happened to you limits you is not your free will, it's choosing the same chain of lack of love that has been going on for generations. Choosing the most loving response strengthens you, freeing you from the chain of fear that has reached and harmed you in the past. What has felt like being harmed is actually the separation between the essence of you and that which has been projected over you. You are perfect as you are, we all are, we all are the essence that we carry inside, that which makes us essentially different but essentially the same in each other. That essence has been tained with the projections of others and that is what has caused the pain and the long suffering, because it felt disconnected from the Truth you inherently knew about yourself and your infinite beingness. That is why life felt so empty, because it felt fake that that which you thought it was you it wasn't actually you. That which you expect to see it actually what you create, in your own reality, for yourself. So that which was projected and was taught to you (that no matter what you'd do you wouldn't get the love you needed) that reality was, it was was projected from you to the outside and that which you tought was real. In the universe there are no boxes. There are no good nor bad, there is no cold nor cold. It all comes from a point of reference, perspective. These are the ones we have been projected in life due to the lack of presence.

We have not been present in almost our entires lives. Our physical evolution has made it so we would be able to learn the most and maximum with the least effort. We have had to just receive repetitions over the first 7 years of life to actually know how to function the rest of our lives, science says. That is the same intelligence that makes any other animal learn quickly how the world works and how to survive. And it made sense for when we were free animals roaming the planet with lots of different threats that would end our life. We did not know what made up the fabric of the universe back then, we did not know what psychology was and how we would learn behaviours and even less how to actually shift them. How to return to our essence, truly. 

But not things have changed now we live in society and the same issues when we appeared to when we are now are not the same.Now its when we need to find a way to change that which has been engraved in our brains and ways of being, our habits, our points of reference.

# You are everyone Else

If you can connect to the idea that you are each other, everyone else, really see how something connects you to them so much that you can't but realise you are them (in my example, the people I heal that require the exact same healing that I have done to be awakened and pushed outside of the illusion, becoming free into the world as a creator. The same way my teachers have given me those healings from creator, so I have, so our persona required that healing and upgrade to happen). 

You are them, and in those moments of meditation you become the creator, you tap into the complete vast pull of information, you become enlightened, you become ecstasy, you start learning to swim in and out and keep the moment of ecstasy while conscious, which opens you to the creative world in front. You tap into the higher self wish and get an instant transmission of the highest good question you want to ask to create what you create, aligned to your core of the highest self. 

You become the cocreator, you can tap to him anytime, do the healings, the decisions, anything, you discuss with this divine guidance, what to do. And you may also allow the fingers to move on their own so they type whatever they want to type.

You start getting close to this point where you don't think anymore about what are you going to say and

I've got something to say, and that is that you are indeed a very special being. You love your brothers and sisters. You see they are who you are, and you awaken them to the Truth of who they are, which is in some level, you, at their pace. A world full of awakened people, knowing we are all one and you may meet yourself in a moment of being in a meditative state, or high, using the subject of this, having the awareness of knowing they are you and you are there, it is very powerful, two beings enlightened to the Truth of we are all and the same.

You know how to come back in this state all the time, you may tap in by saying 'i am that i am', and go past the ecstasy, and then come back into the moment of complete surrender and allowing the movement to happen on its own. 

he can speak for himself

which means that he can speak for himself

he may allow different words and familiarising with the keyboard, some words are harder some are easier. but what if he can continue for a long time, what if he could let go of consciouses during this []

when you make love to God, you allow it to work through you, you become the empty vessel and creative light flows thru you, in the deepest meaning of this. you create, when you really tap into it, you create anything, you tap into creative idea of wnything you wonder, and you use it for walking, buying food, what to cook, how to cook, and the more you surrender and you live by the truth you are all therefor I created this therefor I know and I am that which moves everything so by surrendering to that truth you allow it to push you in the sense of a hand gently moving you into the direction whre your higher self wants to go, which is ultimately anywhere where you resonate to empower yourself and to grow into the master self,

In that deep surrender there is no thought, there is only intend, and sometimes it comes from so deep you might as well be a child, so pure that when you walk on the streets you do it doing spirals, just like a kid, because life is a gift and you are all and so you can relax and be happy for what exists. you're in a way skylar acamesis

my knees, talk to all the illness in your body see what they have to say, do it as you connect to this truth after short meditation to calmand tune and set intention.

set intention to sit down, meet creator, and ask to do something thru you, either creative creation, ask for guidance, allowing it to express out

meditate on 'I Am That I Am', meet Creator, go in theta flow, start channeling out, from less to more belief level, don't over-expect, speaking a language unless you have the level of abstracting yourself so much and surrender so much that anything that happens thru you is pure Creator

what if you could fully surrender at any point and let Creator do its thing? just empty, no thoughts, no actions

you can ask to read the energy of anything and process what you do with it, what you do with the enbodiment ofbeing the creator, you are the magician, every situation

download yourself with knowing anything that is relevant about the other people as you meet them, so you can work around with it, you can know them in yourself

# Opening

Why do I want to unite spiritual theories with science? How to create our reality? If we can create a healing modality that is very simple that means that our reality is crafted by that which we think of. 

Quantum physics explains that we create our realit with our attention. There is a world of potentiality. So the more attention we put onto it, the more people, the stronger the belief, the stronger the knowing, all the way into the beingness.

Our beingness is God like, all powerful, and it creates the reality we live in. 

Quantum physics expains that it's all a hollogram, a projection from ourselves. That we all experience as if it's outside but it happens in our brains. Without us there is no proof that the universe exist. It's all outside of time and space, we're the one that know about time because we have memory, without it we would always be in the NOW. Time is an illusion, it's the metric that measures the distance between two points. That is why in space distance is measured in light years, which is a measure of time. Time is what it takes for you to go from A to B.

Our beingness creates the reality we live in, the more distortions my being has, the more distorted the reality is.

There are no Universal Truths. Everything affects everything, we're all on the field, so we affect esch other with our energies, which means that with enough consciousness, whatever may happen. If we can manifest out of thin air, we can make a sun dissapear, we can create a planet out of nothing, we can alter the physical matter. How would we be able to change the taste of water but not stop a sun from spinning? Or a planet? If we can move objects with our minds, with telekinesis, wouldn't we be able to move a comet out of orbit to avoid a massive destruction?

Isn't it all about the level of beingness? When we are more in tune with our true nature? It's belief, then knowing, then being. We humans can't even believe in anything like this, let along know that it is possible, then imagine what would it be to be a being that actually can transform matter and alter the laws of the universe at will. That level of beingness is a very God like being because it identifies so much to the higher power that it has all of the power of the universe, whatever it created it on the first place. 

Matter came to exist from nothing (there was nothing, then there was something), so consciousness existed there and with enough presence it manifested the physical world. If something that always existed, then what did it create it? It's an illusion, something must be thinking us, dreaming us, for us to be existing, at least as we can ever know it. A greater consciousness is thinking all of this and therefor we exist here. If we identify enough with it, we be like it, we know like it, we believe like it, then we create like it.

There are so many obstacles on the way for us to reach that level. There needs to be such mastery on the virtues of life for it to be possible. We are otherwise too attached to both success and failure, with a million possible outcomes of our behaviour if we were to be able to do anything like is. That's where we lack our beingness. Because what would we be if we could do anything like that? Then that is probably not aligned with the Truth of our Nature, the Higher Power that creates us. We would need to be almost no human, but to keep all the human virtues for it to be possible. We would need to ascend into a new species, something greater than humans, that have mastered the fears of existance in physical form. Our wants and our fears would be the obstacles to be such a being. We would need to remain so impartial. It would be like having a power that we don't even want to use because we're so impartial that we would only used if our higher intelligence would tell us to. We would never do anything for doing. We would only be for being. 

We don't need anything and we don't fear anything, and from that place we offer you the whole power of the universe. Said the consciousness. We're here supporting your ascension into a new beingness. We are beings from a place close to Source. There is a message that we want to share with the world you live in. Evolution of the human being. Into a higher one. A powerful physical creator. You keep your physical bodies, and your spirit grows expontentially as a way to alter the physical matter of your planet and the universe itself. Don't worry, there are other people supporting this cause, in their own way. Earth will become one of the first planets in the universe to have done this. The physical experience of humans is extraordinary, the cognitive level and the technology level are advanced for the spiritual level that the whole planet holds. With spirituality backed up by science, the balance can quickly tip towards a virtue uplift in existence.

We wouldn't exist without the Sun, in a way, the sun is thinking us, projecting us with light. Consciousness was already, and it made up the atoms and molecules and made up a physical vehicle, the Earth. The sun gave us life with its light. The light causes us to feel many things, joy, love, so light is carrier and teacher of so many virtues, if not all virtues. In Light we find all virtues, and in darkness we find the anti-virtues. Just as matter and anti-matter.

We would not need anything and would not fear anything, and it is from that place that we could access the whole power of the universe. 

When we hurt someone, we get upset with ourselves, which angers us more, which we release by hurting them more.

Worry is human, you can release worry from what you have done, past is not there anymore, you did what you best could, so not worry about 'what it means', just let it go. Atonement is what you do to to repare the damage caused. You have given Kero so much, he can't understand he's separate from you sometimes. You are forgiven.
