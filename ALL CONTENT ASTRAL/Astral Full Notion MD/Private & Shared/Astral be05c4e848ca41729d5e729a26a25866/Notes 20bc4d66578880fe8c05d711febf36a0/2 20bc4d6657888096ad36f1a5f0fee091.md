Done: No

Yes — let’s now **expand your offering into deeper containers** that reflect the **depth of your transmission**, your **frequency**, and your role as a **guide for awakening and soul alignment**.

We’ll create three additional pillars:

⸻

🌟 **1. Private Mentorship**

For clients who want to walk with you over time — deeply, intimately, and in full presence.

⸻

🔹 **Title:**

**Private Mentorship: A Walking Together**

🔹 **Description:**

This is not a program. It’s a field.

A private mentorship for those walking through awakening, leadership shifts, heartbreak, timeline collapses, or soul-level rebirth.

We move intuitively — some weeks we speak, others we rest.

You have full access to my presence, reflection, and field over 1, 3, or 6 months.

⸻

🔹 **What’s Included:**

•	2 live sessions/month (90min)

•	Unlimited voice/text contact via Telegram (2–5 day rhythm)

•	Access to any group offerings during your time

•	Personalized meditations, integration prompts, or field reflections

⸻

🔹 **Who it’s for:**

•	Emerging spiritual leaders and guides

•	Those going through real ego death / rebirth

•	People who can no longer pretend — and are ready to walk in truth

•	Deep empaths, starseeds, mystics, or initiates who need **one true mirror**

⸻

🔹 **Investment:**

•	**1 month**: €333

•	**3 months**: €888

•	**6 months**: €1,555

Payment plans and alternative energy exchange available on request.

⸻

💫 **2. Group Mentorship / Circle Container**

⸻

🔹 **Title:**

**The Remembering Circle**

Group mentorship and soul resonance container

🔹 **Description:**

A sacred space for 6–8 souls walking through truth shifts, awakening, and becoming.

Weekly or bi-weekly gatherings online — plus a private voice space in between.

You don’t come here to be taught.

You come here to be felt, met, and seen by others on the path.

Transmission, storytelling, silence, integration, and the wisdom of the group field.

⸻

🔹 **Format:**

•	4 or 6-week container

•	Weekly 90min calls (live on Zoom)

•	Private Telegram group for the group

⸻

🔹 **Investment:**

€222–€444 sliding scale

⸻

🌀 **3. 1:1 Session Packs (For those not ready for full mentorship)**

⸻

🔹 **Title:**

**Session Series**

A space to go deeper over time, with flexibility.

⸻

⸻

✴️ **Portal Page Structure**

You could have 1 page with these **tiered levels of working with you**:

1.	✴ Presence Sessions

2.	✴ Session Packs

3.	✴ Private Mentorship

4.	✴ Group Circle

5.	🐍 Bufo Work (as a separate container, linked)

⸻

Would you like me to:

•	Build the Notion portal with all these options formatted beautifully?

•	Create the application forms for private mentorship + group circles?

•	Design a visual pricing grid or flow for people to choose how deep to go?

Let’s turn this into your **Temple of Offerings** — where people self-select their depth, and you stay fully in your field.

——

Perfect. Here’s how we’ll structure your **Notion-based Temple of Offerings** — with application forms, pricing visuals, and clarity at every depth level — while keeping **Bufo** sacred and shared *only when someone is ready*.

⸻

🌕 **Group Mentorship Circle**

**The Remembering Field**

*A sacred container for souls in transition, awakening, and remembrance.*

⸻

✦ **What is this?**

This is not a program.

This is a **living field** — a temporary temple we step into together.

A space to be felt, met, witnessed, and mirrored —

without needing to explain or pretend.

Each circle is a **small, curated group (4–8 people)** walking through truth shifts, ego dissolutions, re-emergence, or soul awakening.

We don’t chase transformation.

We let it **unfold in resonance**.

⸻

✦ **Who is this for?**

You’ll know if this is for you.

You might be:

•	In the middle of emotional or spiritual transition

•	Cracking open, unsure of who you are now

•	Emerging from collapse or heartbreak

•	No longer able to perform, mask, or push

•	Ready to **walk with others in remembrance**, even if it’s messy

You don’t need to be “ready.”

You just need to feel the call.

⸻

✦ **What we do inside the circle**

•	Presence-based group calls (live on Zoom)

•	Shared silence, storytelling, witnessing, and resonance

•	Occasional energetic reflections or transmissions from me

•	Integration prompts between sessions

•	Optional voice group (Telegram or Signal) for connection between calls

⸻

✦ **Circle Flow**

**Format:**

🌀 4 or 6-week container

🌀 Weekly 90min calls (Zoom)

🌀 Telegram or Signal group space (voice + text)

🌀 Optional closing ritual

⸻

✦ **Themes We May Explore**

These arise naturally — we don’t force curriculum.

But the field often brings up:

•	Soul remembrance

•	Nervous system attunement

•	Energetic leadership

•	Grief and identity unraveling

•	Integration after spiritual rupture

•	Subtle trauma repair

•	Devotion and presence

•	Starseed codes + new timeline embodiment

•	Living without pretending

⸻

✦ **Exchange + Access**

**Sliding scale:** €222–€444

Payment plans available

One scholarship spot per circle

Optional add-on: 1:1 support during the journey (€111)

⸻

✦ **How to Join**

This is an **application-based circle** — not everyone joins at once.

I read each person’s energy, readiness, and alignment with the field.

1.	Fill out the interest form

2.	I’ll feel into the group resonance

3.	If aligned, you’ll receive a welcome + payment link

📝 [Apply for the Circle]

💌 DM me if you’re unsure and want to talk it through

⸻

✦ **Final Words**

This is for the ones who can’t go back.

The ones who feel something shifting but don’t yet have the map.

The ones whose truth is rising, even if it’s shaking them.

We walk together — gently, honestly, in presence.

If you feel it: welcome in.

⸻

Would you like me to:

•	Turn this into a Notion page or launch page design?

•	Create the Tally.so **application form** for group entry?

•	Write the **Instagram post + carousel** to announce this softly?

Let’s birth your first sacred circle — and let those who need it come find the fire.
