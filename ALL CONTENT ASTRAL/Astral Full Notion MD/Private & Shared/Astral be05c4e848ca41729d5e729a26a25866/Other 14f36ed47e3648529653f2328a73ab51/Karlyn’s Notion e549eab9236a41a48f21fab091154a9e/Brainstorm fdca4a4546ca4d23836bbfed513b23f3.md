[09:29, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Also the training I feel we could make it more special
So far I feel it’s rich but it misses the groundbreaking component
It has not been birthed yet
Maybe it’s not about the content but the form
[09:29, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Maybe it’s about creating a system
[09:29, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: That can be a container for it
[09:30, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Idk yet
But I’m bringing that in the space so that we can receive its gift
[09:46, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: It’s like maybe that shamanic Training
[09:46, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Is the same than that shadow work Training
[09:46, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: And creative flow training
[09:46, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: It’s one big life Training
[09:47, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: In a way that’s what we did with our very first retreat in Arambol
[09:48, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Connecting to our conversation yesterday
We could really stretch even more the walls of the vision for this Training
[09:48, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: We’re not specialists and personally I suffer when I try to be
[09:48, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Our gift is the versatility
[09:50, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: So in that Training you could bring your writing skills, the self portrait
I could bring the voice, the psychic awareness
The breath
It’s like an experiential birthing of what has served us to become who we became
A life transmission
[09:53, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: I know we already mentioned to bring energy healing but I invite us to be even broader in our vision

And then when I talk about the form is that it can also be as creative as the content
Maybe it’s not Yang as module 1 module 2
Maybe it has another shape
That is more circular

Like through which lens we want to look at it

Human design used the chakras
Gene keys the yi ching

It’s not about using something necessary that exist but that the form reflects the content as well
[09:55, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: A tree
A map of the cosmos
[09:55, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Bon je sais pas ce que je dis là c’est peut être pour le training ou peut être pour quelque chose d’autre
[09:58, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: The essence is that I want to be excited by what we’re creating and learning from the transmissions themselves
It’s like it’s not only I am going to share what worked for me - cause it already belongs to the past - but rather I am going to create a container that teaches me simultaneously as it is birthed through experientially
[09:58, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Fresh, innovant
[09:59, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: I know there is some of this in Jordi’s writings
I feel there could be more in everything that we bring
The assignments could be more innovant and creative
Also at the moment I’m learning from Spirit some self healing techniques
[09:59, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: All this
[10:02, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: We could meet before you leave
And for a few days
Sitting
Receiving
Even in altered states of consciousness
[10:02, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Doing it on our sides as well already from now on
[10:02, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Keep on expanding the wisdom coming through
[10:03, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Reading your previous writings when you were in awakened state
[10:03, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: And preserving its nectar
[10:04, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Even the manual / or the course curriculum could have that dimension of creativity
[10:04, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Between photos
[10:04, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: And poetry
[10:04, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: And more theorical teachings
[10:04, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: And recordings
[10:04, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: And mini hacking mind videos
[10:04, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Creating an art piece
[10:05, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: I know it feels big
And I’m kind of in overwhelming high Voltage when I tune into it
[10:05, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: But it can be freaking awesome
[10:05, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: I don’t know if I’m chaneling your Bufo ceremony or what
[10:06, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Well I have been quite activated since a few weeks
[10:06, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: And also letting time to thing
[10:06, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Things
[10:06, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Maybe that training is received in a month
[10:06, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Maybe it takes a year
[10:06, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Or more
[10:06, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Killing expectations
[10:06, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Making it really exciting
[10:07, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Of course we can still do weekend trainings and full day masterclasses until then, and it will make the form evolve and teaches us as well
[10:07, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Voilà
[10:07, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: C’est tout
[10:27, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Or the different bodies as a lens
[10:37, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Also
Is there a way you could give me access for a few days to the AI of images
[10:38, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Something came through about working with AI for developing my symbols and make the oracle
[10:38, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Maybe it’s an IA oracle
[10:50, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Maybe Earth Weavers it’s an NGO
[10:51, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: So it could merge inside Inner Ascend as an NGO
With the free crisis support group
My pearl in the gene keys is charity
[10:52, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: I am not solidifying anything now
[10:52, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Just opening possibilities
[10:52, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: So it’s like the direct impact into the Earth
The tangible one
[10:54, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Then the courses have a space for consciousness expansion
Not expansion
Consciousness something
And plant medicines can come there
[10:54, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: I need to let go of the idea of you guys as founders of inner ascend
[10:54, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: Because it prevents me to make it my own
[10:55, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: And to trust I can be free creatively without you having the last word
As in hierarchy

I could see it in the website
If I was suggesting something and you were like « no »
I felt you were entitled to do so
[10:55, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: And I didn’t feel free to defend my point
[10:56, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: So it’s like there can be leadership in the sense of empowering someone to make sure things are done on the executive level
[10:56, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: The left brain structure
[10:57, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: But there should be total freedom and horizontality (spirality) of the creation ship
[10:58, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: It’s a tricky one to navigate sometimes for me
[11:00, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: And as long as I have that image of you as founders I feel tense to give it all to IA
Cause if it’s not mine
One day it could be lost
What I have could be lost
I know it’s only a perception that I need to reshape
[11:01, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: But it’s a lot in the wordings, in the dynamics
[11:01, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: It’s to be reshaped together
[11:05, 22/03/2024] Karlyn Imaya: It takes a real contemplation of all what is cocreated in the dynamics

### Exploration through the lens of the different bodies

At Inner Ascend's Practitioner Training, we view ourselves as multi-dimensional beings, not merely a physical entity. We invite participants to explore this manifold nature through the lens of various 'bodies' - the physical body, mental body, emotional body, astral body, and others. Each body represents a different aspect of our existence, holding a particular narrative of our traumas, patterns, beliefs, and abilities.

In examining the physical body, we delve into the realm of physiology and psychosomatic awareness, illuminating how our physical form holds and expresses traumas and emotions. We learn about and develop the mental body through techniques like mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral strategies, acknowledging how our thought patterns impact our experience of reality.

The emotional body draws our focus to our complex web of feelings and emotions and how they shape our perception. With the astral body, we journey into the subtle realms of energy, intuition, and spiritual connection.

This multi-layered perspective integrates traditional psychotherapy with energy work techniques and psychic awareness. This invites you to not only unravel and heal the psychological aspects embedded within each 'body' but also to ignite your innate capacity to reshape and transcend them.

The real magic happens as we integrate these insights across the different 'bodies,' paving the way for a holistic understanding and transformation of the self. As each 'body' unveils its wisdom, we weave these narratives into a more profound comprehension of our journey, empowering us to embody wholeness and the innate dynamism of our human experience.
