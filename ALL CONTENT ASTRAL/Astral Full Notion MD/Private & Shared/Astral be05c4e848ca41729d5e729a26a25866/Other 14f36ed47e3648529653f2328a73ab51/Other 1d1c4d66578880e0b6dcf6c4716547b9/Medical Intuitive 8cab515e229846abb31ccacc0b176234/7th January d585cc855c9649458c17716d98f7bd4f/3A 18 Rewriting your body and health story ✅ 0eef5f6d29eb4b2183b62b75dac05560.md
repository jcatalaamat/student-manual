# 3A.18 Rewriting your body and health story ✅

When we're trying to heal our bodies we have to look at that story:

- What are you telling yourself when you look in the mirror in the morning about your body?
    - I’m ugly, my belly is fat, my body parts are ugly.
- What is your body story? Set aside an hour of your time to write down your body story and your health story for half an hour each.
    - Body story
        - I tell myself that my body is not worth it. That he is a sack, ugly and fat. That it doesn’t belong to me. That I can’t make anything to change it. That it’s fat and it will be fat. That my face is ugly. That I am slow, I take care of nothing worthy. I can’t make anything happen.
        - I am alone. Was born alone. Will die alone. People won’t love me. People won’t take care of me.
        - Life is hard. Work is pain. Work is hardship. Creating a new life is not possible. Love is hard. Love is pain. Creating a new world is not love. Creating a new life is pain. Loving myself is not loving my family. Loving myself is not taking care of others. I have to suffer in order to love. I safe to take on people’s harsdhips in order to love. I have to take on people’s pain in order to grow. I can’t love without loving others. I can’t love without sacrifice. I have to die for others peoples love. I have to die in order for god to love me.
    - Health story
        - I am sluggish. I am vitamins and minerals. My mind is my own monster. I can’t create the world I truly want to live in. I am insane. I am crazy. I grow ugly and unhealthy. I get old. I have vision problems. I cope with sugar.
        - My health is not my choice. I can’t heal. I can’t take supplements. I can’t eat healthily. I can’t support myself. I cant guide myself. I cant heal others. I cant heal my loved ones. I can’t support anyone. Love is not real. Health is not possible. I must die in order to grow. I must die in order to heal. I can’t heal. I can’t heal alone. I can’t support anyone. I can’t support others. I can’t take care of my needs. I can’t take care of myself.
        - I can’t support my path. I can’t support my health. I can’t support my spiritual path. I can’t heal my body. I am not meant to heal. I am meant to suffer for all times. I am meant to deal with the traitor. I am meant to suffer. I am meant to fight god. I am meant to not trust. I can’t heal. I am meant to clear no pain. I am meant to heal not. I am not meant to be here. I am not meant to be happy. I am meant to take people’s trash and suffer. I am meant not to hold myself in love and accountability.

The next phase is to combine the positive story that you wrote about your health and the positive story that you wrote about your body, and the new belief systems that you want
to have and create your guided meditation recording.

This is the exact same procedure that you're going to use with your clients. If you want to use this in your business as well as to make yourself healthy, it is just as effective for you as
it is for other people.
If you are ill and you're just thinking about doing this for your business, please do this for yourself first. Please do not just do this technique for other people if you are ill and it
doesn't just mean physically ill - if you struggle with anxiety, if you struggle with depression, whatever it is that you're facing that you think is too small, even if it's just acne or
infection, please do this exercise anyway.

When you experience the power of this exercise you will see the worth that you are giving to the people in your life, and the value that you're adding and this is going to explode your
business and give you the certainty that this process works once it's worked for you.
