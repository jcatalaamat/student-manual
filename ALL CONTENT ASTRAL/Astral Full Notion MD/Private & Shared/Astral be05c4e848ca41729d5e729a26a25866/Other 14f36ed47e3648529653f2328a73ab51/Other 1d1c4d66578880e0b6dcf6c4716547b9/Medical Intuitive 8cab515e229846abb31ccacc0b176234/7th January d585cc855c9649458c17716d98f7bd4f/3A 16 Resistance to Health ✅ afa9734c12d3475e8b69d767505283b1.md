# 3A.16 Resistance to Health ✅

- Why are you resisting your health?
    - Because I owe my mother and my parents a lot of things I have done ‘wrong’. Because I’m a ‘bad’ boy. I must hurt myself to be close to God. I must hurt myself to love my mother and my parents. I must die.
- What's really going on with you?
    - I am exhausted. I have given up. I am devastated. I am hurt. I am isolated. I am lonely. I am a sad little boy. I am hurt. I hate my parents. My parents hurt me. I am being abused. I am responsible. I am the cause of my parents suffering.
- Why are you afraid of being healthy?
    - I have to be corrected in order to be happy. I have to be punished in order to be healthy. I am afraid that if I am healthy I will not care about others and I will let them go. That I will abandon my partner, my child. That I will release all ties with this life and I will evaporate in the ether. That I will become superhuman and that I will be tracked down and hunted for my psychic gifts. I will be too big to contain. Too big to not be jealous of. Too big to control.
- What happened for you to start believing that you are unworthy of health, or that you didn't want to be healthy anymore, or that you didn't even want to be on this planet
anymore that you want to die? What happened?
    - My mum abandoned me. Left me to cry for 20 minutes and it felt like lifetimes. I felt like I was dying.
    - My mum hit me, again, and again. And yelled at me. Yelled her heart out on me. Dropped me all her anger.
    - I felt I had to take care of my mother and imitate what she was and her way of taking care of herself in order to belong, to be taken care of, to be one more, to be part of the family, to be human, to be like society wants you to be. To follow. To be less than others. To be safe.
