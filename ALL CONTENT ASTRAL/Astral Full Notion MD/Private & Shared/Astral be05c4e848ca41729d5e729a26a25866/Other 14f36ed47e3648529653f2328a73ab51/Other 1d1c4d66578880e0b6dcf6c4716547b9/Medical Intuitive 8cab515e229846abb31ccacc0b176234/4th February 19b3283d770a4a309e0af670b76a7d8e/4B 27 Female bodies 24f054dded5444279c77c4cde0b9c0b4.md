# 4B.27 Female bodies

If you're in a male body, please take your journal and write

- Where do you think these conditionings are affecting the women that you know in your life?
    - I can see many people judging themselves for not eating less or not having an ideal weight. I see women bodies being starving in order to be that image that has been sold into the matrix.
    - I see women who are working on distractions as a way to protect themselves for truly facing the fear of the power they have and the grief of the long lost time they have waited in order to find themselves again.
    - I see women with fear of speaking up, of condoning, of allowing when things are not ‘right’ and yet not expressing what they feel with fear of violence or prosecution or persecution. Afraid of being shut and rejected.
