# 4A.24 Healing sleep

For your journaling homework around sleep, I want you to, for a week, track your sleep cycles, whether it's with a Fitbit or with your phone. There are apps that track your sleep
cycles without you having to have anything on a watch or anything else like that.
Start writing down:

- What are your feelings about sleep? Do you resist it? Do you sleep well?
    - I resist going to sleep sometimes. It takes me long to be like ok I can go to sleep now. I stay up ‘late’. I mean late like 10:30 to 11:30pm or so. I have a baby LOL. But still. I can feel how I stay up trying to get things done. I sleep directly. I normally get in bed or any time I lay down if I feel like I want to sleep I can sleep within 5 minutes. Sometimes it takes me longer but I’ve done something just that keeps my body awake.
- What are your dreams like? Do you remember your dreams or do you not remember any at all?
    - My most dreams are about infiltrations, war, like playful but with shootings. Then I have others that are more like Astral projecting, doing energy healing on myself while asleep, out of my body, and recently my first in a spaceship where I was getting healing done through some aliens. I am able to be quite conscious throughout my astral projections / lucid dreaming.
    - Sometimes it feels stressful, specially the shooting ones.
    - Sometimes I dream that I fly or I am a skydiver and love to drive my helicopter and jump again and again and keep flying. Freeing.
- What comes up for you around sleeping by yourself? What comes up for you around sleeping with other people, both sexually and also just intimately, where you're just sharing a
bed or cuddling up?
    - I love cuddling up with my wife Nina. We love spending time sleeping and being physically intimate. I don’t resonate to sleeping physically with other people. It gets me anxious. I remember once I used to share bed with friends and at some point (once my kundalini awakening came through) I couldn’t anymore. I could feel people’s pains and it became very discomforting.
    - I am working through realising that I don’t want to have sexual relationships outside my sacred union. It’s taken me time to awaken this and realise how much I was scaping through sex and ‘connection’ outside of commitment to my one.
    - There are others I could probably sleep in peace, cuddle up, take a nap, or sleep through the night. These are people who I trust their energy.
- What comes up for you around sleep? Were you scared of going to bed as a child because you thought you had monsters in the cupboard, or because you were afraid of the dark?
    - I can’t really recall. I feared there were monsters under the bed, they could bite my hands or feet if coming out. Sometimes I’d see shadows on parts of the room. Sometimes I feared my dreams. People were trying to get me, to bite me. Dinosaurs. I don’t remember not wanting to go to sleep tho.
- What comes up for you around sleep in general?
    - I love sleep. I sleep long. sometimes 10 or 11 hours. I try to sleep for as long as possible. I try to stay in bed until I really feel like it’s time to get out. I don’t cut down.
    - I generally would prefer to sleep earlier, wake up earlier. Have more awake time in that form. Like I know sometimes bedtime procrastination not so ‘good’ behaviours come out the later in the night I go to sleep.
- How about, especially if you're a parent, how does it come up around your kids? Do they sleep well? Do they not sleep well? Do you co-sleep?
    - We co-sleep, she’s 3 months now. She’s great. She sleeps almost all night. From around 7-8pm to 6-7 in the morning. She begins waking up around 2 and Nina breastfeeds her while laying down so she falls asleep again. Often times I don’t get up. We don’t have to walk her around to go to sleep (only the first month, because we didn’t know this technique).
- Do you sleep alone? How has it affected your life? How is sleep changing the way that your body heals or repairs during the day?
    - I loved sleeping on my own. Very private. Very healing. Would place my hands in a reiki style and sleep very flat. Would love cuddling up with my bedsheets. In a way I miss it. To spend this time alone.
- Do you sleep lightly now?
    - Not really. I sleep sound. Very deep. And yet very light in my dreams. Like I can feel when I come out of my body, also recall dreams.

When you're ready listen to the healing guided meditation first and to your sleep re-imprinting healing for at least a month, just so you can create a healthy sleep pattern, especially
if you've never had one. Pop over to the group and let us know how you got on with this module. Share what you journaled and share what comes up for your own sleep.
