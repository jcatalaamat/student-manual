# 5B.38 The Eyes

Write down:

- What are your judgments about skin colour?
- What are your judgments about height, about build, about strength?
- What should a woman look like?
- What should a man look like?
- What should the world look like?
- What areas of your life do you see clearly in? And what are you too close to to see properly? Because it's about perception and you want to get clear about the beliefs that are
around your eyes
- Do you have prejudices around eye colour? Do you believe that blue is more beautiful than green? Or more beautiful than black?
- Do you really look people in the eyes? Or do you find it too intimate?
- Do you walk with your eyes cast towards the ground? Or do you literally walk at face level?
- Where do you bring your energy when it comes to your eyes?
- Where do you focus your energy?
