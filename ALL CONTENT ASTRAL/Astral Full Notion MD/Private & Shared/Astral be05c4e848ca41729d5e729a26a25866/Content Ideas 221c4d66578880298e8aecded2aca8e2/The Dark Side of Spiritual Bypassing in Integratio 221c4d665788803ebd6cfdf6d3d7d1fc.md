Caption/Script: Ever noticed how 'spiritual bypassing' shows up in psychedelic integration? Here's the thing: true healing isn't about skipping to the good vibes. It's about sitting with the uncomfortable stuff too.

In my integration practice, I often see clients who've been told to "just focus on the light" after intense medicine experiences. But here's what gets missed: those difficult emotions are INFORMATION. They're not obstacles to your healing‚Äîthey ARE the healing.

The shadow work IS the work. And honestly? I'd rather help you move through your darkness with honesty than paint sparkles on your pain.

Real talk: What parts of your journey have you been avoiding in the name of 'high vibes only'?
Hooks: "High vibes only" might be the most damaging phrase in modern spirituality. Here's why your healing depends on ditching it...
CTA: Drop a comment about a 'spiritual bypass' you've experienced or witnessed. Let's get real about this together. Or DM me if you're struggling with integration that honors ALL parts of your experience.

Text: The concept of spiritual bypassing, where individuals avoid difficult emotions in favor of maintaining a positive spiritual outlook, can hinder genuine healing and integration. It is essential to recognize and process painful experiences rather than dismiss them in pursuit of "good vibes." This approach can lead to deeper understanding and growth, allowing individuals to address the full spectrum of their emotional experiences. Engaging with the shadow aspects of one's journey is crucial for authentic integration and healing.
