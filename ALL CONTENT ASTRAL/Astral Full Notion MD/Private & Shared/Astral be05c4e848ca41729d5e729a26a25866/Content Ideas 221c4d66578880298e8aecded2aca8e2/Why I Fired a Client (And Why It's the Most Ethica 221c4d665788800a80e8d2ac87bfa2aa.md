Caption/Script: Last month, I turned away a high-paying client seeking Bufo facilitation.

He had the money. He had the time. He'd done his research. But something felt off in our initial consultation.

When I asked about his motivation, he said: "I want to experience ego death because I've heard it's the ultimate high."

I probed deeper about integration support, his mental health history, and preparation. His answers revealed he was treating this like a bucket list item rather than a profound healing journey.

So I said no. And recommended therapy first.

Was it an easy decision? No. That money would have been nice.

But here's what I believe: Medicine work isn't for everyone at every time. Sometimes the most ethical thing we can do as practitioners is say "not now" or "not with me."

We need more discernment in this field, not less. More practitioners willing to turn down money when the fit isn't right.

Have you ever had to make a difficult ethical decision in your work? How did you handle it?
Hooks: I turned away a client who could have paid my rent for 3 months. Here's why I don't regret it for a second...
CTA: If you're considering working with plant medicines or Bufo, make sure your facilitator is willing to say no when necessary. It's one of the best signs of integrity you can find.
