Yes. That line carries *so much*.

**“And you should already be there.”**

It’s the weight most people carry without realizing it.

Let’s build a full IG story pack just around that one line.

Not adding fluff — just unfolding the truth it holds.

## **⏳**

## **“And You Should Already Be There”**

*IG story format — raw, honest, straight to the point*

---

**slide 1**

Most people live with a quiet pressure:

You should already be there.

---

**slide 2**

Already healed.

Already successful.

Already calm.

Already clear.

---

**slide 3**

Already over it.

Already doing the thing.

Already past the pain.

---

**slide 4**

You’re late.

You’re behind.

You’re too slow.

You’re not enough.

---

**slide 5**

That voice doesn’t come from truth.

It comes from conditioning.

---

**slide 6**

From a culture that rewards speed

and punishes stillness.

---

**slide 7**

From parents who didn’t have space

to let you unfold.

---

**slide 8**

From systems that confuse value

with productivity.

---

**slide 9**

You’re not behind.

You’re not broken.

You’re not too late.

---

**slide 10**

You’re exactly where you are.

And that’s enough.

---

**slide 11**

There is no “there.”

Only here.

---

Would you like me to turn this into a carousel too? Or want another one based on a single line like that?

(Examples:

**“Rest feels like failure”**

**“Success doesn’t feel safe”**

**“Healing is not a performance”**)

I can keep them coming.
