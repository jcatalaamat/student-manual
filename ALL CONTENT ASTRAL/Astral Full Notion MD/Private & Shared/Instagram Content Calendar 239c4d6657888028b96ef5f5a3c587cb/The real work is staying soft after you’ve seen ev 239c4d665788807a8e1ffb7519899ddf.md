The real work is staying soft after you’ve seen everything.”

—

After the ceremony.

After the death.

After the clarity.

You’re left with one question:

“Now that I’ve touched the infinite…

can I still be human?”

Can I do dishes

with this ache in my chest?

Can I speak kindly

while still feeling shattered?

Can I be with others

who are still asleep —

without closing my own eyes again?

This is the real work.

Not the vision.

Not the breakthrough.

But the slow return

to tenderness

after knowing too much.
