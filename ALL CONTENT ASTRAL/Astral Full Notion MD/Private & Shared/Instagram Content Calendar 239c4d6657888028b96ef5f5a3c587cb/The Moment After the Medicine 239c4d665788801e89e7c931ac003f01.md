“No one tells you how quiet it gets.”

—

After the visions fade

and the body stills

and the crying ends —

there’s just breath.

No downloads.

No messages.

No grand mission to share.

Just you.

Sitting in a room

with a heart that’s a little more raw

than before.

—

This is the part no one posts.

Not because it’s bad.

But because it’s real.

You’re not glowing.

You’re not a teacher.

You’re not enlightened.

You’re just here.

And for the first time

in a long time

that feels like enough.
