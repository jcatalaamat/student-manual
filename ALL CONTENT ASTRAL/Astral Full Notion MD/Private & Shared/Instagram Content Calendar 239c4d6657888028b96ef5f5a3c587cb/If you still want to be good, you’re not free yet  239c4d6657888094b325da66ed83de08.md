If you still want to be good, you’re not free yet.”

—

Good daughter.

Good man.

Good healer.

Good lightworker.

It’s all branding.

Even if it’s subtle.

Even if it’s soft.

Freedom costs more than that.

It asks for your roles.

Your charm.

Your control.

It doesn’t care

how clear your voice sounds

if it’s still coming

from fear.

—

If you’re ready to be seen

as you are —

without managing perception —

that’s when it begins.
