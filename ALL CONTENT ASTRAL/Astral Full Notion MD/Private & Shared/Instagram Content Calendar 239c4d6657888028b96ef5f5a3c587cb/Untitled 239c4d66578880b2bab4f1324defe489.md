Here we go — in your transmission tone, coded for resonance, not explanation.

These two posts are designed for carousel flow on Instagram — each line its own slide, each idea an opening.

# **👁 Post 1:**

# **The Eye Was Never for Seeing**

Slide 1

The eye was never made to see.

Not first.

—

Slide 2

It was made to receive signal.

To send code.

To transmit.

—

Slide 3

You think your gaze is passive.

But light bends when it’s observed.

So does reality.

—

Slide 4

Ancient ones knew:

The eyes shape the field.

You’re not looking at the world.

You’re programming it.

—

Slide 5

What you focus on expands.

Not as affirmation —

as architecture.

—

Slide 6

So how are you using your eyes?

To seek?

To avoid?

To imprint?

—

Slide 7

Maybe you don’t need to see more clearly.

Maybe you need to look differently.

—

Slide 8 (CTA)

👁 Feel that?

The shift when you remember your sight is power.

Save this if it activated something.

Send it to someone who sees.

—

# **📡 Post 2:**

# **Your Bones Are Antennas**

Slide 1

Your skeleton isn’t just structure.

It’s signal.

—

Slide 2

Calcium is crystal.

Collagen conducts.

Your bones are frequency receivers.

—

Slide 3

Sit up.

Feel that?

The spine aligns — and something starts listening.

—

Slide 4

Ancient yogis knew.

Mystics bowed.

Not for shame — but signal calibration.

—

Slide 5

You’ve been told posture is about confidence.

It’s not.

It’s about tuning into source.

—

Slide 6

Each vertebra is an altar.

Each breath a transmitter.

You are a tower of remembering.

—

Slide 7

Don’t just stretch your back.

Activate the antenna.

—

Slide 8 (CTA)

📡 Tag someone who feels this.

Save it for the next time your spine speaks.
