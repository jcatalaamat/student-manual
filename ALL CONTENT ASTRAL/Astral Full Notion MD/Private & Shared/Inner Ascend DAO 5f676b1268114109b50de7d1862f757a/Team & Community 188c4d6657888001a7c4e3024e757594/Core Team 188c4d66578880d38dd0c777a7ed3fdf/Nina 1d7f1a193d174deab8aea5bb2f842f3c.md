INNER ASCEND - Bridging Ancient Earth with Future Ways

OUR MANIFESTO

We are stepping out of the over-capitalization of the healing industry and offering a fairer alternative to self-development by prioritising community-driven growth, equitable access, and mutual support over profit. We are redefining the concept of a conscious community while witnessing the fall of new-age spirituality. We are looking for a third way focused on the human factor, on how to heal and support each other as we live in reciprocity with the Earth. We are stepping out of various forms of cultural appropriation and looking for sustainable ways to engage in an artistic dialogue with all backgrounds and heritages, reclaiming a more grounded approach to the sacred that resonates with each individual’s truth. We are focusing on how to actively support each other’s growth, healing, and evolution. **We are looking to offer shelter for those dedicated to supporting the collective, and we are resisting moulding of ideologies, practices and modalities as well as vertical hierarchy, assuming that we are all teachers and all students in our uniqueness. We hold each individual through finding and expressing their heart's truth — unadulterated.

INTRODUCTION

*We spearhead a global revolution through a community committed to growth and service to the collective. Our mission is to nurture and support those holding the forefront of the emergence of new consciousness and empower trailblazers and pioneers.*

INNER ASCEND is an organisation tha*t* offers a nurturing environment for people looking to develop their gifts and embody their purpose, bringing forth a wave of non-conformist individuals who rethink the world.

VISION

Our focus is on redefining togetherness and enhancing self-sufficiency and sovereignty without reliance on external power structures or obedience to overarching governmental systems. We see ourselves as inland islands, united by common values and the shared dream of creating a utopia. We are dedicated to our personal and collective evolution, becoming fully realised humans aware of contemporary challenges and equipped to address them. We foresee a new way of inhabiting Earth that is both locally grounded and globally aware, capable of providing refuge and harmony for those seeking an alternative lifestyle.

STRUCTURE

We are creating a community network that provides a nurturing environment where members actively exchange and offer their unique skills and talents. This environment supports each member's journey of personal growth. We are mainly focused on helping individuals dedicated to the evolution of humankind & global consciousness, emphasising the importance of nurturing the next generation.

The objective of the project is to provide physical, energetic and spiritual shelter, a sanctuary—a place for those who have not found their kin, who don't fit in, for the exiles and wanderers, the artists at heart, the romantic dreamers, the poetic souls, and the healing healers. This refuge is for those seeking connection, authenticity, and a true sense of belonging.

**Core Principles**:

- ***Radical Co-living and Education**:*Pioneering educational systems that focus on self-sovereignty, radical authenticity, conscious communication, aligned relationships, emotional awareness, and energetic mastery.
- **Sustainable and Transparent Governance:** Utilizing a non-profit organisation for equitable decision-making, fostering the horizontal circulation of resources and abundance in a genuinely transparent manner.
- **Revolutionary Economic Systems:** Embracing anti-capitalist values through a new economic model based on local tokens, service exchange, and a sliding scale of financial contributions, allowing for dynamic and interconnected global participation.

INNER ASCEND is a movement dedicated to redefining consciousness and communal living on a global scale. By joining us, members engage in a revolutionary project aimed at transforming societal norms and creating a sustainable, thriving future for all. Our approach is not merely an alternative but a necessary evolution, inviting all to redefine their engagement with the world.

INNER ASCEND is more than just a community; it’s a movement towards redefining how we live on Earth, focusing on integrity, devotion, and redefining consciousness. It’s an incubator for those ready to pioneer new ways of being, offering a unique platform to birth and share transformative ideas.
