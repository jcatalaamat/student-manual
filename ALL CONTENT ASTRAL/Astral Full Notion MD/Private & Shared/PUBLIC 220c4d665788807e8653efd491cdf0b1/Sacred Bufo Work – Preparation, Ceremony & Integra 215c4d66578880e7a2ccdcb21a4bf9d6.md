# **💠 Who This Is For**

You may feel called if:

- You’ve been through deep inner work and feel the call to complete something
- You are not seeking an experience — but a death of illusion
- You want to remember truth, not escape
- You feel spiritually ripe — but emotionally unsure
- You are ready to meet your resistance, ego, attachments — and let them go

**This work is not suitable for:**

- Those with untreated trauma or psychosis
- People chasing “highs” or peak states
- Anyone expecting “healing from someone else”
- Anyone who refuses to integrate or slow down

# **🌙 Final Note**

I have sat with the medicine. I have died, dissolved, returned, and broken again.

I hold this work with reverence.

If you feel called, let’s walk slowly.

This is sacred territory — not a service.

Trust yourself.
