## About the Work

### How is this different from therapy or coaching?

This work isn't therapy or coachingâ€”it's sacred companionship. There's no diagnosis, treatment plan, or agenda to fix you. Instead, it's deep witnessing and presence for your soul's authentic process. While therapy focuses on healing trauma and coaching on achieving goals, this work honors whatever wants to emerge in the moment.

### What if I've never done spiritual work before?

Perfect. This work doesn't require any spiritual background or beliefs. All that's needed is openness to being witnessed without judgment. Whether you're completely new to this realm or deeply experienced, you'll be met exactly where you are.

### What actually happens in a session?

We meet in presence. There's no set structure or techniqueâ€”each session unfolds organically based on what's alive for you. Sometimes there's talking, sometimes silence, sometimes tears, sometimes laughter. The only constant is deep listening and sacred witnessing.

### Do I need to prepare anything beforehand?

Nothing special is required. Simply come as you are. Some people like to set intentions or create sacred space, but there's no pressure. The most important preparation is permission to be authenticâ€”raw, uncertain, joyful, or whatever you're experiencing.

## Practical Questions

### What platform do you use for sessions?

Sessions happen via Zoom or phone/voice call, depending on your preference. Video often creates more intimacy, but voice can feel safer for some. We'll find what works best for you.

### What timezone are you in? When are sessions available?

Sessions are typically available throughout the week, including some evening and weekend slots. Exact scheduling is coordinated based on mutual availability and what serves your process best.

### How quickly do you respond to messages?

For Telegram/Signal support, I typically respond within a few hours during waking hours, often sooner. If you're in crisis or urgent need, please indicate that and I'll prioritize accordingly.

### What if I need to reschedule?

Life happens. With 24+ hours notice, rescheduling is completely fine. Less than 24 hours may incur a partial session fee, but emergencies are always handled with compassion and flexibility.

## Investment & Accessibility

### How do I choose my sliding scale rate?

Trust your inner knowing. Choose the rate that feels sustainable without creating stress, while also honoring the value of the work. There's no judgmentâ€”this is about accessibility, not finances determining worthiness.

### What if I can't afford even the lowest rate?

Reach out anyway. In special circumstances, further accommodations may be possible. Money should never be a barrier to this work for those genuinely called to it.

### Do you offer payment plans?

Yes, payment plans are available for multi-session containers. We can arrange monthly payments or other schedules that work for your financial rhythm.

### What payment methods do you accept?

PayPal, Stripe, Revolut, Wise, bank transfer, and cryptocurrency. We'll find the method that works best for your location and preferences.

## Safety & Boundaries

### Is this work safe? Are there any risks?

This work is generally very safe, focusing on presence and witnessing rather than intense therapeutic techniques. However, deep work can sometimes bring up intense emotions or memories. If you have serious mental health concerns, please ensure you have appropriate support systems in place.

### What if I have a mental health condition?

This work can complement but doesn't replace professional mental health treatment. If you're working with a therapist or taking medication, that's completely welcomed. Please share any relevant information so we can work together safely.

### How do you maintain confidentiality?

Everything shared in our work together is held in complete confidentiality. Client stories or testimonials are only shared with explicit permission, and identifying details are always protected.

### What are your boundaries around contact?

Ongoing support via Telegram/Signal is included in multi-session containers, but this isn't 24/7 crisis support. For immediate safety concerns, please contact local emergency services or crisis lines.

## The Process

### How will I know if this work is right for me?

You'll know. There's usually a resonanceâ€”something in the words, approach, or testimonials that speaks to your soul. If you're uncertain, a clarity call can help you feel into whether this is aligned for you right now.

### What if I don't feel anything during a session?

Perfect. Not all transformation is dramatic or immediately felt. Sometimes the most profound shifts happen in the subtle realms and integrate over time. There's no "right" way to experience this work.

### How many sessions will I need?

This completely depends on what you're navigating and what feels aligned. Some people find exactly what they need in a single session, others are called to longer containers. There's no pressure to commit beyond what feels true for you.

### What if we're not a good fit?

Sometimes connections aren't meant to be, and that's completely honored. If after our initial conversation or first session it doesn't feel aligned, we can discuss other practitioners or approaches that might serve you better.

## Integration & Follow-up

### What happens after our sessions end?

Integration continues long after our formal work together. Many people find insights and shifts unfolding for months afterward. You're always welcome to reach out with questions or for additional sessions as life evolves.

### Do you offer ongoing support after containers end?

While formal ongoing support ends with the container, you're welcome to reach out occasionally with questions or to book additional sessions as needed. This work creates lasting connections.

### What if I want to work together again in the future?

Many people return for additional work as they navigate new life passages or thresholds. You'll always be welcomed back, and we can explore what type of container would serve your current process.
