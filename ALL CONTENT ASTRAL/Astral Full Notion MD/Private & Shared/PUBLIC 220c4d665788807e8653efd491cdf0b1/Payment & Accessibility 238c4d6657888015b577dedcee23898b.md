# Payment & Accessibility

**Sacred exchange made accessible**

---

## Investment Philosophy

This work honors the principle of sacred exchangeâ€”energy flowing both ways to create sustainable containers for transformation.

Money is simply one form of energy exchange. The goal is accessibility without devaluing the profound nature of this work.

---

## Sliding Scale Approach

All offerings use sliding scale pricing to honor different life circumstances while maintaining the integrity of the work.

### How to Choose Your Investment Level

**Lower End of Scale:** Choose this if you're currently experiencing financial hardship, are a student, single parent, or facing temporary financial challenges.

**Middle of Scale:** Choose this if you're financially stable and can comfortably afford this investment without strain.

**Higher End of Scale:** Choose this if you're financially abundant and want to support accessibility for others while investing fully in your own transformation.
