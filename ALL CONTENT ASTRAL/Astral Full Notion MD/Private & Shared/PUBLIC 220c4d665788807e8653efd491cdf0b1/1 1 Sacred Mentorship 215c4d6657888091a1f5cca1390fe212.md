This is for you if:

- You’re in transition (identity, home, relationship, work, motherhood…)
- You’ve experienced spiritual awakening and need grounding
- You feel emotionally or energetically fragmented
- You’re healing from burnout, grief, heartbreak, or confusion
- You want to soften into your truth, your rhythm, your body again
- You’re seeking sacred reflection and gentle accountability

Not therapy. Not coaching.

This is presence work. Deep listening.

We go at your pace. And you are held the entire way.
