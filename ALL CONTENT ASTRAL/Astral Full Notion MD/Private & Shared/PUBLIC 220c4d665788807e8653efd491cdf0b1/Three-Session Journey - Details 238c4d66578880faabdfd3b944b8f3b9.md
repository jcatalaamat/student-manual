# Three-Session Journey - Details

**For when something deeper is unfolding**

---

## What This Is

A sacred arc over 3–6 weeks designed as a container for the in-between. This is for souls unraveling an identity, integrating big experiences, or navigating the delicate dance between collapse and awakening.

This journey holds space for what's shedding while meeting what's rising.

---

## Who This Is For

- Those feeling called to go deeper than a single session
• People integrating plant medicine experiences or other consciousness shifts
• Anyone navigating identity dissolution or major life transitions
• Those needing support through a specific transformational period
• Souls ready for gentle but sustained witnessing

---

## The Container

### Session Structure

- **3 x 75-minute sessions** spaced over 3–6 weeks
• **Flexible timing** based on your process and needs
• **Via Zoom or voice** - whatever feels most supportive

### Between Sessions

- **Weekly check-ins via Telegram** (voice or text)
• **Gentle prompts or rituals** if they feel aligned
• **Space to share** whatever is moving through you
• **No pressure** to perform or progress linearly

---

## What to Expect

### Session 1: Opening & Witnessing

We create the container and meet whatever is present. No agenda beyond deep listening and sacred witnessing.

### Session 2: Holding the Middle

The heart of the journey. We hold whatever is unfolding—the messy, the beautiful, the uncertain.

### Session 3: Integration & Grounding

Honoring what has moved through and supporting your embodiment of whatever wants to be integrated.

## Client Reflection

> "It feels like a very smooth but very clear change of energy on a very deep level. I feel I'm boosted full of love and energy. The sessions created space for parts of me that rarely get witnessed, and I felt held through a really tender transition." — Blanka
