# About Astral

*The human behind the work*

---

## Who I Am

I'm someone who has walked through my own fires and emerged not unscathed, but transformed. My path to this work wasn't linearâ€”it came through my own unraveling, awakening, and the profound recognition that some experiences can only be held by someone who has touched the depths themselves.

I don't consider myself a healer in the traditional sense. I'm more of a witness, a companion for souls navigating the territories where maps fall apart and new ways of being want to emerge.

## My Journey

### The Unraveling

Like many who do this work, I came to it through necessity. My own spiritual emergence looked more like a controlled demolitionâ€”everything I thought I knew about myself, life, and reality had to be deconstructed so something more authentic could be born.

### The Awakening

Through plant medicines, meditation, energy work, and deep inner exploration, I discovered realms of consciousness that aren't typically acknowledged in our culture. More importantly, I learned how to navigate these states and integrate them into daily life.

### The Integration

The real work began after the profound experiencesâ€”learning how to live as someone fundamentally changed in a world that often doesn't recognize these shifts. This integration process taught me the importance of grounded, practical support during spiritual transformation.

## What I Bring

### Deep Listening

I've cultivated the ability to listen not just to words, but to the soul beneath them. This listening creates space for what wants to emerge naturally, without forcing or directing.

### Presence without Agenda

I don't have a program, technique, or outcome I'm trying to create. My gift is being fully present with whatever is happening in the moment, trusting your inner wisdom to guide the process.

### Understanding of Non-Ordinary States

Having navigated my own spiritual emergence and worked with consciousness-expanding medicines, I understand the territory of expanded awareness and can provide grounded support for integration.

### Sacred Witnessing

I hold space for the full spectrum of human experienceâ€”the beautiful and the difficult, the mystical and the mundane. Nothing is too much, too weird, or too raw.

## My Approach

### Not Fixing, Just Witnessing

I don't see anyone as broken or needing to be fixed. Instead, I see souls in the process of becoming more authentic, and my role is to witness and support that natural unfolding.

### Beyond Traditional Modalities

While I've studied various healing approaches, this work transcends specific techniques. It's about presence, consciousness, and the profound healing that happens when someone is truly seen and accepted.

### Integration Focus

Having experienced how challenging it can be to integrate profound shifts into daily life, I emphasize practical, embodied integration rather than just peak experiences.

### Honoring Your Process

Your soul knows what it needs. My job isn't to direct your process but to create safety for your authentic expression and natural healing to occur.

## What Calls Me to This Work

### Personal Experience

Having been profoundly supported during my own transformation, I feel called to offer the same quality of presence to others navigating similar territories.

### Soul Recognition

There's something that happens when souls who have walked similar paths recognize each other. This work allows for that deep recognition and mutual witnessing.

### Bridge Building

I'm passionate about helping people integrate spiritual experiences into practical life, bridging the mystical and the mundane in sustainable ways.

### Sacred Service

This work feels like my authentic contributionâ€”using my own journey and gifts in service of others' becoming.

## My Understanding

### Consciousness is Primary

I work from the understanding that consciousness is the foundation of reality, and that shifts in consciousness naturally create changes in all areas of life.

### Healing is Natural

The soul knows how to heal itself when given the right conditions. My role is creating those conditions through presence, safety, and non-judgmental witnessing.

### Process Over Outcome

I trust the organic unfolding of each person's journey rather than trying to create specific outcomes or timelines.

### Integration is Everything

Peak experiences are beautiful, but the real transformation happens in how we embody and integrate these shifts into our daily existence.

---

## Beyond the Work

When I'm not holding space for others, I'm usually found in nature, exploring consciousness through various practices, or simply living the integration of this work in my own life. I believe in walking the path I support others onâ€”continuing to grow, explore, and deepen my own understanding.

I'm also deeply interested in the intersection of spirituality and practical life, sustainable community, and how we can collectively navigate the times we're living in with presence and authenticity.

---

## A Personal Note

This work chooses us as much as we choose it. I consider it a profound privilege to witness souls in their becoming, and I don't take that responsibility lightly. If you feel called to work together, know that you'll be met with complete presence, acceptance, and honor for your unique journey.
