I'M ASTRAL

I guide people to their inner sense of self-realization.

For over a decade, I've held space for thousands of souls navigating
the depths of transformation‚Äîthrough energy healing, medicine integration,
family constellations, and embodied practices.

My work is a crossing between coaching, teaching, energy healing, therapy,
and mysticism. I help you become the self you haven't dared to be.

Based between Mazunte, Mexico and Barcelona, Spain, I work with
individuals, groups, and communities ready to shed the old
and step into their divine essence.

## üìñ ABOUT PAGE

### Hero Section

**Copy:**
```
THE JOURNEY TO HERE

Every healer has their own awakening.
Mine began with a breakdown that became a breakthrough.
```

---

### About Content
**Layout:** Alternating image/text sections (storytelling format)

**Copy:**
```
THE BREAKDOWN

For years, I performed. I wore masks. I did what I thought I was
supposed to do. Until my body, my mind, and my soul said: NO MORE.

The breakdown looked like: psychosis, relationship collapse, identity
dissolution, hitting rock bottom. What I didn't know then was that
rock bottom would become my foundation.

[Image: Personal/vulnerable photo]

---

THE AWAKENING

Plant medicine showed me who I was beyond the story. Bufo Alvarius
dissolved the ego I'd spent decades building. And in that dissolution,
I found what I'd been searching for all along:

Nothing. And everything.

I found presence. Consciousness. Love that isn't conditional.
The realization that I am already whole.

[Image: Ceremony/spiritual moment]

---

THE WORK BEGINS

But awakening isn't enough. Integration is where the real work happens.

I spent years learning from elders, shamans, therapists, healers.
I trained in:
- Family Constellations
- Somatic Therapy
- Energy Healing
- Access Consciousness
- Theta Healing
- Bufo Facilitation
- And countless other modalities

Not to collect certifications. But to EMBODY the healing.

[Image: Teaching/holding space]

---

BECOMING THE GUIDE

Now, I hold space for others on this journey.

I've facilitated hundreds of Bufo ceremonies.
Held space for thousands of healing sessions.
Witnessed countless breakdowns become breakthroughs.
Guided men to reclaim their power.
Supported women to embody their leadership.
Helped souls remember who they are.

This is my purpose. My medicine. My gift.

[Image: You with community/clients]

---

LIFE NOW

I live between Mazunte, Mexico and Barcelona, Spain.
I'm a father, partner, healer, teacher, and eternal student.

I believe in:
- Conscious community over individualism
- Integration over enlightenment
- Embodiment over intellectual knowing
- Service over ego
- Love as the ultimate medicine

I'm here to walk with you. Not above you. Beside you.
