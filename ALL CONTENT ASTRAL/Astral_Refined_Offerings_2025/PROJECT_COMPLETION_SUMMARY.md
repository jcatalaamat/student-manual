## 🔑 Key Insights & Decisions

### 1. Voice Evolution

**The evolution from 2025 doc → Notion was significant:**

**Before (2025 doc):**
- "TRANSFORM YOUR LIFE"
- "BECOME WHO YOU'RE MEANT TO BE"
- "DM NOW TO BOOK"
- Achievement and transformation language
- Marketing-focused

**After (Notion - lived experience):**
- "If this calls to you, send a message"
- "This is not for everyone"
- "I hold space, I don't fix"
- Witnessing and presence language
- Service-focused

**Decision: Use Notion voice (trauma-informed, humble, real)**

---

### 2. Pricing Philosophy Evolution

**Before:**
- Fixed prices: €3,600, €4,200, €5,100
- Standard business model
- Success/transformation language

**After:**
- Sliding scale: €1,200-2,400 (25-50% offerings)
- Radical accessibility
- "Honor sliding scale as sacred practice"
- Multiple tiers for different access levels

**Decision: Keep sliding scale, emphasize accessibility**

---

### 3. Service Structure

**Before (2025 doc):**
- Broad menu of services
- All offerings equal weight
- No clear pathway

**After (Notion):**
- Clear progressive pathway
- FREE entry point
- Structured journey options
- But missing group offerings

**Decision: Blend both—clear pathway + full service menu**

---

### 4. Missing Offerings Identified

**From Notion (not in 2025 doc):**
- FREE Clarity Call
- 3-Session Journey
- 6-Week Deep Presence
- Threshold Path (different from 6-month intensive)

**From 2025 doc (not in Notion):**
- All circles (Men's, Women's, Creative, Healing, Parenthood)
- All trainings (Bufo Teacher, Integration Practitioner, etc.)
- Inner Ascend membership structure

**Decision: Include EVERYTHING in unified document**

---
