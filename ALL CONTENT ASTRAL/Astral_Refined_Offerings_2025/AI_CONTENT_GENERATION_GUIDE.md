## 🎨 Voice Calibration: Keeping It Authentic

### The Problem with AI

AI defaults to:

- Guru positioning
- Hype and superlatives

### Your Authentic Voice

**You are:**

- "I hold space, I don't fix"
- "This isn't for everyone"
- "Send a message if it resonates"
- Simple, clear language
- Humble, grounded tone
- Trauma-informed framing
- Presence-based (not achievement)

❌ DON'T USE:
- "Transform your life!"
- "Become who you're meant to be"
- "Book now / DM now"
- "Limited spots"
- FOMO tactics
- "Unlock your potential"
- "Manifest" or "align"
- Guru positioning

EXAMPLES OF MY ACTUAL VOICE:

## 🎯 Quality Control Checklist

Before posting AI-generated content, check:

### ✅ Voice Alignment
- [ ] Sounds like you (not generic AI)
- [ ] Humble, not performative

- [ ] Image suggested (if applicable)

### ✅ Human Touch
- [ ] Add 1-2 personal words/phrases
- [ ] Remove any AI tells ("delve," "transformative")
- [ ] Add your energy
- [ ] Check it feels true

**Rule:** If it doesn't sound like something you'd say, edit it.

---

## 💡 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: AI sounds too "corporate" or "guru"

**Solution:**
Strengthen your voice guidelines in the prompt. Add this:

```
ANTI-EXAMPLES (never write like this):
- "Unlock your highest potential"
- "Transform your life in 90 days"
- "Limited spots available"
- "Are you ready to step into your power?"

MY ACTUAL VOICE (always write like this):
[Paste 5-10 real sentences from your workbooks]
```

---

### Problem: Content is too generic

**Solution:**
Provide more specific source material. Instead of:

```
Write about spiritual emergence
```

Use:

```
Write about spiritual emergence using this exact framework:

[Paste your specific 8-phase model from Workbook 1]

This is MY model. Use this specific language and framework.
```

---

### Problem: AI invents offerings or details

**Solution:**
Always include this constraint:

```
CONSTRAINT: Only mention offerings that exist in this list. Do not invent or assume.

MY ACTUAL OFFERINGS:
[Paste exact list from Unified Offerings]

If you mention pricing, use exact ranges provided.
```

---

### Problem: Output is too long/short

**Solution:**
Be specific about length:

```
LENGTH: Exactly 250-300 words (not more, not less)

Or

LENGTH: 3-5 bullet points, each 15-20 words
```

---

### Problem: Content feels sales-y

**Solution:**
Reframe the CTA in your prompt:

```
CTA OPTIONS (choose one):
- "Save this if it resonates"
- "DM if this calls to you"
- "Explore this in [workbook name]"
- No CTA (just share value)

DO NOT USE:
- "Book now"
- "Limited spots"
- "Don't miss out"
- "Transform your life"
```

## 🙏 Final Tips for Success

### 1. **Start Small**
Don't try to automate everything at once. Master one content type first.

### 2. **Maintain Your Voice**
Always add your human touch. AI assists, you create.

### 3. **Track What Works**
Note which prompts and content types get best engagement.

### 4. **Iterate Prompts**
Your prompts will improve with use. Save your best ones.

### 5. **Batch Create**
Generate content in batches (monthly social, weekly emails) for efficiency.

### 6. **Quality > Quantity**
Better to post 1 authentic piece than 10 generic AI posts.

### 7. **Use Source Material**
Always ground AI generation in your actual content (workbooks, notes).

### 8. **Edit Everything**
Never post raw AI output. Always review and personalize.

### 9. **Stay True**
If it doesn't feel authentic, don't post it.

### 10. **Experiment**
Try different tools, prompts, formats. Find what flows for you.
