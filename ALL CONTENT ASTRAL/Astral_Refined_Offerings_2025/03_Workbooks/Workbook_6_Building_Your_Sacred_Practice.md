**You've:**
- Read the books

Has your life actually changed?

**This workbook is about the gap between knowing and living.**

- Choose practices that resonate
- Design your daily structure

**Then:**

## Why Practice Matters

### The Difference Between Knowing and Being

**You know:**
- You should be present
- You should feel your emotions
- You should live authentically
- You should connect with your body

**But:**

Knowing doesn't change you.

**Practice changes you.**

### Why Most People Don't Practice

**Common reasons:**

**"I don't have time."**
→ You have time for what matters.

**"I don't know what to do."**
→ You're overthinking it.

**"I keep forgetting."**
→ You haven't made it a structure.

**"It doesn't work."**
→ You're expecting magic instead of showing up.

**"I'm not good at it."**
→ There's no "good" or "bad." Only doing it.

**"I'll start Monday."**
→ No you won't.

### What Practice Actually Does

**Over time, practice:**
- Rewires your nervous system
- Embodies insights
- Creates new neural pathways
- Builds capacity for presence
- Makes truth automatic (not effortful)
- Anchors you in your body
- Gives you tools for life
- Connects you to something larger

**But only if you do it.**

**Daily.**

**Not perfectly. Just consistently.**

## The Trap of Spiritual Consuming

### Are You Consuming or Practicing?

**Check yourself:**

**Consuming looks like:**
- [ ] Reading endless spiritual books
- [ ] Listening to all the podcasts
- [ ] Taking workshop after workshop
- [ ] Collecting techniques and modalities
- [ ] Always learning the next thing
- [ ] Never actually doing the work
- [ ] Talking about spirituality (not living it)
- [ ] Seeking the perfect practice
- [ ] Waiting to feel ready

**Practicing looks like:**
- [ ] Same practice daily (even when boring)
- [ ] Embodying one thing deeply
- [ ] Showing up when you don't feel like it
- [ ] Simple practices done consistently
- [ ] Living differently (not just knowing more)
- [ ] Less talking, more doing
- [ ] Committed to one path (not hopping)

**Which are you?**

### Spiritual Bypassing Through Consuming

**Consuming can be avoidance:**

Instead of:
- Feeling your grief → Read about grief
- Sitting with discomfort → Listen to podcast on discomfort
- Changing your life → Attend workshop on change
- Being present → Learn about presence

**Consuming feels productive.**

**But it's often escape.**

### The Antidote: Simple, Daily Practice

**Stop:**
- Seeking the perfect practice
- Collecting more tools
- Waiting to know enough
- Reading this after this paragraph

**Start:**
- One practice, daily
- Simple and doable
- 10-30 minutes
- No matter what
- For at least 90 days

**That's it.**

---

## Designing Your Practice

### The Core Principles

**Effective practice is:**

**1. Simple**
- Not complex
- Not 47 steps
- Doable even when tired
- Easy to remember

**2. Short (at first)**
- 10-30 minutes daily
- Can extend later
- But start small
- Consistency > duration

**3. Sustainable**
- Works with your life (not against it)
- Flexible but consistent
- You'll actually do it
- Not another should

**4. Embodied**
- In your body (not just head)
- Felt (not just thought)
- Physical component
- Grounding

**5. Yours**
- Resonates with you
- Not someone else's practice
- Authentic
- Feels true

### The Essential Elements

**Every practice should include some form of:**

**1. Grounding**
- Connecting to body
- Feeling feet on earth
- Breath awareness
- Arriving in present moment

**2. Opening**
- Creating sacred space
- Setting intention
- Invoking presence
- Dropping in

**3. Core Practice**
- Meditation/sitting
- Movement
- Breathwork
- Journaling
- Whatever your main practice is

**4. Integration**
- Reflection
- Gratitude
- Closing
- Carrying practice into day

### Your Practice Assessment

**Before designing practice, answer:**

**Practical:**
- How much time can I realistically commit daily?
- What time of day works best for me?
- Where will I practice?
- What supports will I need?

**Personal:**
- What practices have worked for me before?
- What doesn't resonate (even if "should")?
- What does my body need?
- What does my heart want?

**Honest:**
- Will I actually do this?
- Am I overcomplicating?
- Am I performing for some imagined spiritual standard?
- What's the simplest version that would work?

   - Release tension
   - Soften
   - Melt into bed

## Meditation & Stillness

### Simple Sitting Practice

**No technique. Just sitting.**

**Setup:**
- Comfortable seat (chair or cushion)
- Spine upright (not rigid)
- Hands on lap or knees
- Eyes closed or soft gaze down

**Instructions:**
1. Sit
2. Feel your body
3. Notice breath (don't force it)
4. When mind wanders, notice, return to body
5. Repeat endlessly
6. Just be

**That's it.**

**No goal. No achievement. Just presence.**

### How Long?

**Beginners:**
Start with 5-10 minutes.
Increase gradually.

**Established practice:**
20-45 minutes daily.

**What matters:**
Consistency (not duration).
Better: 10 min daily than 1 hour once a week.

### What to Expect

**Common experiences:**

**Boredom:**
Good. Sit with it.

**Restlessness:**
Feel it in body. Stay.

**Thoughts (endless):**
Normal. Not a problem. Notice. Return to body.

**Sleepiness:**
If tired, rest. If avoiding, stay.

**Peace:**
Nice when it comes. Don't chase it.

**Nothing special:**
Most of the time. That's okay. Sit anyway.

### Types of Meditation

**If basic sitting doesn't work:**

**Body Scan:**
- Systematically feel each body part
- Head to toe
- Notice sensations

**Breath Focus:**
- Count breaths (1-10, repeat)
- OR feel sensation of breath
- Return when mind wanders

**Mantra:**
- Repeat phrase silently
- "Here. Now." or "I am." or "Peace."
- Return when mind wanders

**Open Awareness:**
- No focus
- Just aware of being aware
- Spacious
- Advanced

**Choose one. Stick with it. Don't hop around.**

## Movement as Practice

### Movement is Medicine

**Not exercise (though it can be).**

**But:**
Moving energy through body.
Shaking loose what's stuck.

## Journaling as Practice

### Why Journal?

**Journaling:**
- Externalizes thoughts
- Reveals patterns
- Integrates experiences
- Tracks growth
- Processes emotions
- Connects to truth

**Not:**
- Performing for future reader
- Making it pretty
- Censoring yourself

**But:**
Raw. Honest. Real.

### Daily Journaling Prompts

**Morning:**
```
- What's present this morning?
- What am I feeling in my body?
- What's my intention for today?
- What quality do I want to embody?
```

**Evening:**
```
- What did I notice today?
- Where was I present?
- Where did I forget/perform?
- What am I grateful for?
- What's asking for attention?
- What am I releasing?
```

### Deep Journaling Practices

**Weekly Deep Dive (30-60 min):**

Pick a question and write for 20+ minutes non-stop:

```
- What am I avoiding feeling?
- What's the pattern I keep repeating?
- What am I pretending not to know?
- What does my body want to tell me?
- What's asking to die in me?
- What wants to be born?
- What would I do if I wasn't afraid?
- Who am I without my story?
```

**Stream of consciousness:**
No editing. No stopping. Just write.

### Integration Journaling

**After:**
- Ceremony
- Breakthrough
- Insight
- Difficult experience

**Write:**
- What happened?
- What do I understand now?
- What's shifting?
- What wants to be integrated?
- What's my next step?

**Return to this regularly.**

## Nature as Teacher

### Why Nature?

**Nature:**
- Grounds you instantly
- Mirrors natural rhythms
- Shows impermanence
- Teaches presence
- Connects to something larger
- Calms nervous system

**It's not optional.**

**It's essential.**

### Daily Nature Practice

**Minimum:**
10-20 minutes outside daily.

**Just:**
- Feet on earth
- Look at sky/trees/water
- Feel wind/sun
- Breathe fresh air
- Be with what's alive

**No phone. No music. Just presence.**

### Deeper Nature Practices

**Nature Sit (30-60 min):**
- Find a spot in nature
- Sit still
- Watch. Listen. Feel.
- Let nature be your teacher
- Notice what arises

**Solo Nature Time (half day to multiple days):**
- Time alone in wild
- Minimal gear
- Minimal doing
- Maximum presence
- Vision quest style

**Seasonal Awareness:**
- Notice what season it is
- How does your body respond?
- What's nature teaching through this season?
- Align your practice with seasons

### Nature as Mirror

**When in nature, ask:**

```
What is nature showing me right now?

The wind is... (what does it teach?)
The tree is... (what does it model?)
The water is... (what does it reveal?)
The season is... (what does it mirror?)

What in me is like this?
```

**Nature is always teaching. Always.**

## Working With Resistance

### Resistance Will Come

**You will:**
- Not feel like practicing
- Forget
- Get too busy
- Tell yourself "I'll start tomorrow"
- Find 1000 excuses
- Feel like it's not working
- Want to quit

**This is normal. This is the path.**

### Meeting Resistance

**When resistance comes:**

**Step 1: Notice**
"I'm resisting my practice."

**Step 2: Feel it**
Where is resistance in your body?

**Step 3: Ask**
"What is this resistance protecting me from?"

**Step 4: Decide**

**Option A: Honor it**
Sometimes you genuinely need rest.
Skip practice. Rest.

**Option B: Practice anyway**
Often resistance is avoidance.
Do the practice (even 5 min).
You'll feel better after.

**Step 5: Compassion**
Either way, no self-judgment.

### The 5-Minute Rule

**When you don't want to practice:**

**Commit to 5 minutes.**

Just 5.

**Usually:**
Once you start, you'll continue.

**But even if you stop at 5:**
You practiced. That's what matters.

### Common Forms of Resistance

**"I'm too busy."**
→ Make it 5 minutes. You have 5 minutes.

**"I'm too tired."**
→ Practice anyway. Shorter is fine.

**"It's not working."**
→ You're expecting magic. Just practice.

**"I forgot."**
→ Set alarms. Structure supports consistency.

**"I'll start Monday."**
→ Start now. Not Monday. Now.

## Making It Sustainable

### Why Most Practices Fail

**Common reasons:**

**1. Too ambitious**
- 2 hour morning practice
- For someone who currently does nothing
- Doomed from start

**2. No structure**
- "I'll practice when I feel like it"
- You won't feel like it
- Needs routine

**3. All or nothing thinking**
- Missed one day, feel like failure
- Quit entirely
- Instead: Just begin again

**4. No accountability**
- No external support
- Easy to skip
- Needs witness or structure

**5. Performing**
- Practicing for image
- Not authentic
- Burns out quickly

### Making It Stick

**Start small:**
5-10 min daily (not 1 hour).

**Same time, same place:**
Routine makes it automatic.

**Non-negotiable:**
Like brushing teeth.
Not optional.

**Track it:**
Simple checkmark on calendar.
Build the chain.

**Get support:**
- Accountability partner
- Morning practice group
- Text someone daily

**Adjust, don't quit:**
Not working? Modify.
Don't abandon entirely.

**Celebrate:**
Acknowledge consistency.
30 days. 60 days. 90 days.

### The 90-Day Commitment

**Research shows:**
90 days to build a habit.

**Commit to 90 days:**

Write it:
```
I commit to [specific practice]
Every day for 90 days
Starting [date]

My practice is:
[Write it specifically]

My accountability is:
[Person/system]

Signed: ________________
Date: ________________
```

**Then do it.**

**No matter what.**

**90 days.**

## The Sacred Container

### Creating Sacred Space

**Your practice needs a container.**

**Physical space:**
- Dedicate a spot
- Cushion, mat, or chair
- Can be corner of room
- Keep it consistent

**Make it sacred:**
- Candle
- Incense
- Sacred objects
- Photo of teacher/ancestor
- Whatever makes it special

**Why:**
Visual cue: "This is practice space."
Supports dropping in.

### Opening Practice

**Before you practice:**

**Create container:**
1. Arrive at your space
2. Light candle (or other ritual)
3. Take 3 breaths
4. Set intention:
   "I dedicate this practice to [what matters to you]"
5. Begin

**This marks: "Practice time begins."**

### Closing Practice

**After practice:**

**Close container:**
1. Gratitude ("Thank you")
2. Seal the practice (hand on heart)
3. Bow (if that resonates)
4. Blow out candle
5. Carry practice into day

**This marks: "Practice time complete."**

### Making Everything Sacred

**Advanced:**

Every act can be practice.

**Washing dishes:**
- Feel water
- Breath awareness
- Present

**Making coffee:**
- Smell
- Warmth
- Slowness

**Walking to car:**
- Feel feet

## When Life Gets Hard

### Practice During Crisis

**Do this (5 min):**
1. Feet on ground
2. Three breaths
3. Hand on heart
4. "I am here"

**That's enough.**

### Adjusting Not Abandoning

**Life changes.**

**Your practice adjusts.**

- But don't quit

**Illness:**

## Final Words

### This is the Path

**Not:**
- One more thing to read
- Conceptual understanding
- Spiritual knowledge

**But:**
- Daily showing up
- Embodied transformation
- Living presence

### You Know Enough

**Stop:**
- Seeking more information
- Waiting to feel ready
- Looking for the perfect practice
- Consuming spiritual content

**Start:**
- Practicing daily
- Showing up imperfectly
- Doing something simple
- Living it

### The Practice Teaches

**You don't need:**
- To understand it all first
- To be good at it
- To feel spiritual
- Perfect conditions

**You just need:**
- To begin
- To show up daily
- To be willing
- To keep going

**The practice itself teaches.**

**The practice transforms.**

**But only if you do it.**

### Begin Now

**Not Monday.**

**Not when you feel ready.**

**Now.**

**Close this workbook.**

**Choose one practice.**

**Do it today.**

**Then tomorrow.**

**Then the next day.**

**That's the path.**
