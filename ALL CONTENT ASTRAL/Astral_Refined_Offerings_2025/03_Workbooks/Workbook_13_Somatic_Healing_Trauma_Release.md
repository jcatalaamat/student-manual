## Welcome to Somatic Work

### Your Body Holds Everything

**Not in your head.**

**In your body:**
- Every trauma
- Every loss
- Every time you weren't safe
- Every time you couldn't fight or flee
- Every moment you froze

**Your body:**
- Remembers
- Stores
- Protects
- Knows

**And healing happens:**

**Not through thinking about it.**

**But through feeling it.**

**In your body.**

### What This Workbook Offers

**Not:**
- Another way to analyze trauma
- Cognitive processing
- Top-down healing
- Thinking your way through

**But:**
- Bottom-up healing (body first)
- Somatic tools and practices
- Nervous system regulation
- Trauma release through sensation
- Body literacy development
- Practical, embodied work

---

## Understanding Trauma in the Body

### Trauma is Not the Event

**Trauma is:**

Not what happened to you.

**But:**

What happened inside you when it happened.

**And what:**

Your nervous system couldn't complete.

### The Incomplete Response

**When something threatening happens:**

**Your body prepares to:**
- Fight
- Flee
- Freeze

**This is automatic.**

**Survival response.**

**If you can fight or flee:**

Energy completes.

Nervous system discharges.

You return to baseline.

**If you can't:**

You freeze.

Energy gets stuck.

Nervous system stays activated.

**This stuck energy is trauma.**

### Where Trauma Lives

**In your body:**

**Muscles:**
- Chronic tension
- Bracing
- Armoring
- Holding patterns

**Nervous system:**
- Hypervigilance
- Reactivity
- Shutdown
- Dysregulation

**Fascia:**
- Tightness
- Restriction
- Holding
- Memory

**Organs:**
- Gut issues
- Heart racing
- Shallow breath
- Digestive problems

**This is not "in your head."**

**This is cellular.**

---

## The Nervous System Basics

### Two Branches

**Sympathetic (Gas Pedal):**
- Activation
- Fight or flight
- Energy up
- Alert
- Ready for action

**Parasympathetic (Brake Pedal):**
- Rest and digest
- Calm
- Recovery
- Social engagement
- OR shutdown/freeze

**Healthy nervous system:**

Moves fluidly between:
- Activation (when needed)
- Rest (when safe)

**Traumatized nervous system:**

Gets stuck in:
- Hyperactivation (constant fight/flight)
- OR hypoactivation (shutdown/freeze)
- OR ping-ponging between both

---

## Polyvagal Theory Made Simple

### Three States

**Polyvagal theory (Stephen Porges):**

Your nervous system has three states:

### 1. Ventral Vagal (Social Engagement)

**The safe & connected state.**

**Feels like:**
- Calm but alert
- Open and social
- Curious and playful
- Connected to others
- Safe in the world

**Body:**
- Heart rate regulated
- Breathing easy
- Face soft
- Eyes bright
- Gut relaxed

**This is where healing happens.**

---

### 2. Sympathetic (Fight or Flight)

**The mobilized defense state.**

**Feels like:**
- Anxious
- Angry
- Hypervigilant
- Can't sit still
- Reactive

**Body:**
- Heart racing
- Breathing shallow/fast
- Muscles tense
- Sweating
- Restless

**Purpose:** Protect you from threat.

**Problem:** Can't turn off when threat is gone.

---

### 3. Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown/Freeze)

**The immobilized defense state.**

**Feels like:**
- Numb
- Disconnected
- Frozen
- Depressed
- Can't feel
- Can't move

**Body:**
- Low energy
- Shallow breath
- Heavy
- Can't think
- Dissociated

**Purpose:** Play dead when can't fight/flee.

**Problem:** Gets stuck here.

---

### The Ladder

**Think of it as a ladder:**

**Top:** Social engagement (safe)

**Middle:** Fight/flight (mobilized)

**Bottom:** Shutdown/freeze (immobilized)

**Trauma makes you:**
- Stuck on a rung
- Unable to climb to safety
- OR constantly falling between rungs

**Healing is:**

Learning to climb back to the top.

To social engagement.

To safety.

---

## Somatic Experiencing Practices

### Feeling Sensations (Not Stories)

**In somatic work:**

You don't talk about trauma.

**You feel:**
- Body sensations
- Physical experience
- Sensation as it is

**Without:**
- Story
- Meaning
- Analysis

**Just:**

Sensation.

### Basic Somatic Practice: SIBAM

**Track five streams:**

**S - Sensation**
What do you feel physically?
(Tight, warm, buzzing, heavy, etc.)

**I - Image**
What images arise?
(Colors, shapes, memories, scenes)

**B - Behavior**
What does your body want to do?
(Shake, push, run, curl up)

**A - Affect**
What emotions are present?
(Fear, anger, sadness, joy)

**M - Meaning**
What meaning comes?
(Thoughts, beliefs, understanding)

**Track these without getting lost in any one.**

**Just notice. Name. Move on.**

### Grounding Practice

**When overwhelmed:**

**Come into your body:**

1. **Feel your feet**
   Press them into ground
   Feel the contact
   Notice weight

2. **Name what you see**
   5 things you can see
   Out loud
   Brings you present

3. **Touch something**
   Texture, temperature
   Feel it fully
   Ground through touch

4. **Orient to space**
   Look around room
   Notice where you are
   You're here, now, safe

---

## Titration & Pendulation

### Titration: Slow & Small

**Titration means:**

Working with trauma in tiny doses.

**Not:**
- Flooding yourself
- Reliving it all at once
- Overwhelming your system

**But:**
- A little bit at a time
- Just the edge
- Stay within your window

**Like:**

Homeopathic doses.

Small.

Gentle.

Effective.

### The Window of Tolerance

**Your nervous system has a window:**

**Inside the window:**
- Can feel without overwhelm
- Can process
- Can heal

**Outside the window:**
- Too much (hyperarousal)
- OR too little (hypoarousal)
- Can't process
- Re-traumatizes

**Titration keeps you:**

In the window.

Where healing happens.

### Pendulation: Movement

**Pendulation means:**

Swinging between:
- Activation and calm
- Sensation and grounding
- Trauma and resource

**Not:**

Staying in trauma.

**But:**

Touch trauma → return to resource.

Touch trauma → return to resource.

Back and forth.

**This teaches your nervous system:**

You can go into activation and come back to calm.

You can feel it and survive.

### Practice: Pendulation Exercise

**1. Find a resource**

Something that feels good/calm/safe:
- Memory of being held
- Image of nature
- Feeling of your feet on ground
- Sensation of warmth

**Feel it fully.**

**Notice:** Where in your body? What sensations?

---

**2. Touch the edge of trauma**

Not the full trauma.

**Just the edge:**
- Slight tension
- Mild discomfort
- Beginning of activation

**Notice:** Where in your body? What sensations?

---

**3. Return to resource**

**Come back to the good feeling.**

Ground.

Regulate.

---

**4. Repeat**

Trauma edge → Resource.

Trauma edge → Resource.

**This is healing.**

---

## Working With Freeze & Collapse

### The Freeze State

**Many trauma survivors live in freeze:**

**Feels like:**
- Can't move
- Paralyzed
- Stuck
- Numb
- Disconnected

**This was:**

Your survival response.

**Playing dead when you couldn't fight or flee.**

**It saved you.**

### Thawing Freeze

**Freeze needs:**
- Gentleness
- Time
- Safety
- Movement (eventually)

**Don't:**
- Force it
- Push through
- "Just move!"
- Shame yourself

**Do:**

**1. Build safety first**

Freeze thaws when you feel safe.

Create:
- Safe spaces
- Safe people
- Predictability
- Control

---

**2. Tiny movements**

Not big exercise.

**Tiny:**
- Wiggle fingers
- Move toes
- Turn head slightly
- Shift weight

**This wakes the system.**

---

**3. Tremoring/shaking**

Let body shake spontaneously.

This discharges freeze.

(More on this below)

---

**4. Orient to environment**

Look around.

Notice you're safe now.

"I'm here. I'm safe. I can move."

---

**5. Slow, gradual activation**

Walk.

Gentle movement.

Build capacity slowly.

---

### The Collapse State

**Dorsal shutdown:**

**Feels like:**
- Depression
- Exhaustion
- Hopelessness
- Heavy
- Can't function

**This is:**

Nervous system in deepest shutdown.

**Working with collapse:**

**1. Don't force positivity**

This isn't "just think positive."

**This is nervous system state.**

Needs somatic work.

---

**2. Gentle activation**

- Cold water on face
- Gentle movement
- Music
- Singing
- Being with animals

**Small doses.**

---

**3. Co-regulation**

Being with someone whose nervous system is regulated.

Their regulation can help yours.

---

**4. Professional support**

Collapse often needs:
- Somatic therapist
- Trauma work
- Sometimes medication

**Don't go it alone.**

---

## Shaking, Movement, Breathwork

### Shaking: The Body's Natural Release

**Animals shake off trauma.**

**After a chase:**

Gazelle shakes.

Releases the activation.

Returns to calm.

**Humans:**

Were taught not to shake.

**But shaking is:**
- Natural
- Healing
- Necessary

### Shaking Practice (TRE-based)

**Trauma Release Exercises:**

**1. Tire the legs**

- Wall sit (until shaking)
- Or standing, knees slightly bent, bounce gently

---

**2. Lie down**

- Knees up, feet flat
- Let knees fall together (supported or trembling)

---

**3. Allow the shake**

Don't control it.

Let body shake wherever it wants.

Legs, belly, jaw, arms.

**Let it be involuntary.**

---

**4. Continue 10-15 minutes**

Or until complete.

---

**5. Rest**

Lie still.

Feel your body.

Integration.

---

**Do this weekly (or more).**

**Powerful release.**

---

### Breathwork for Regulation

**Breath is the bridge:**

Between conscious and unconscious.

You can regulate nervous system through breath.

**Box Breathing (Calming):**

- Inhale 4 counts
- Hold 4 counts
- Exhale 4 counts
- Hold 4 counts
- Repeat 5-10 minutes

**Calms sympathetic activation.**

---

**Extended Exhale (Parasympathetic):**

- Inhale 4 counts
- Exhale 6-8 counts
- Repeat
- Activates rest/digest

**Soothes anxiety.**

---

**Breath of Fire (Activating):**

- Quick, sharp exhales through nose
- Passive inhales
- 1-3 minutes

**Energizes from shutdown.**

---

**Breath Awareness (Grounding):**

- Just notice breath
- Don't change it
- Feel it moving
- Anchor in present

---

## Touch & Boundaries

### Touch Can Heal or Harm

**For trauma survivors:**

Touch is complex.

**Can be:**
- Deeply healing
- Triggering
- Violating
- Confusing

**All at once.**

### Consent in Touch

**Always:**
- Ask permission
- Specific ("Can I place my hand on your shoulder?")
- Right to decline
- Right to change mind

**Never:**
- Assume
- Touch without asking
- Continue if someone freezes
- Make them feel bad for saying no

### Self-Touch Practices

**You can touch yourself:**

**Hand on heart:**
- Calming
- Self-soothing
- "I'm here for you"

**Butterfly hug:**
- Cross arms over chest
- Alternate tapping shoulders
- Self-regulation

**Grounding touch:**
- Hands on belly
- Feet on earth
- Feeling your own body
- Reclaiming your body as yours

---

## Developing Body Literacy

### Learning Your Body's Language

**Your body speaks:**

Not in words.

**In:**
- Sensations
- Tensions
- Releases
- Impulses

**Body literacy is:**

Learning to read these messages.

### Daily Body Check-In

**3x daily (or more):**

**Stop. Ask:**

"What am I feeling in my body right now?"

**Scan:**
- Head to toe
- Notice sensations
- Don't judge
- Just notice

**Name:**
- Tight shoulders
- Butterflies in belly
- Heavy chest
- Warm hands

**This builds:**
- Interoception (internal awareness)
- Connection to body
- Early warning system
- Self-knowledge

### Sensations Vocabulary

**Expand your language:**

**Instead of:**
"I feel bad"

**Try:**
"I feel tight in my chest, fluttery in my belly, heavy in my limbs"

**Learn to name:**
- Hot/cold
- Tight/loose
- Heavy/light
- Sharp/dull
- Buzzing/still
- Expanded/contracted
- Flowing/stuck

**More precise language = more body literacy.**

---

## Trauma-Informed Movement

### Movement as Medicine

**Yoga, dance, martial arts:**

Can be:
- Deeply healing
- OR re-traumatizing

**Depends on:**
- How it's taught

## When to Seek a Somatic Therapist

### Solo Practice Has Limits

**Seek professional help when:**

- [ ] Trauma is severe or complex
- [ ] You're overwhelmed by sensations
- [ ] Dissociation is frequent
- [ ] You can't regulate alone
- [ ] Freeze state is chronic
- [ ] Self-harm urges present
- [ ] You're stuck despite trying

**Somatic therapy modalities:**

- Somatic Experiencing (SE)
- Sensorimotor Psychotherapy
- EMDR (has somatic component)
- Hakomi
- TRE (with trained facilitator)
- Body-based trauma therapy

### What to Look For

**Good somatic therapist:**
- [ ] Trauma-informed
- [ ] Trained in body-based modality
- [ ] Respects your pace
- [ ] Emphasizes safety
- [ ] Uses titration
- [ ] Tracks your nervous system
- [ ] Doesn't push or force
- [ ] Has done their own trauma work

**Red flags:**
- Pushes catharsis
- Forces eye contact
- Touches without consent
- "We need to go into the trauma"
- Dismisses your limits
- Overly directive

**Trust your nervous system.**

**If it doesn't feel safe, it isn't.**

---

## Daily Regulation Practices

### Morning Grounding

**5-10 minutes:**

**1. Body scan**
Feel your body waking.

**2. Grounding**
Feet on floor, feel earth.

**3. Breath**
5-10 deep breaths.

**4. Movement**
Gentle stretching or shaking.

**5. Orientation**
Look around. Notice where you are. Safe.

---

### Throughout Day

**When dysregulated:**

**STOP Practice:**

**S**top what you're doing
**T**ake 3 deep breaths
**O**rient to your surroundings
**P**roceed with awareness

---

**5-4-3-2-1:**

- 5 things you see

- 3 things you hear
- 2 things you smell
- 1 thing you taste

**Immediate grounding.**

---

**Cold water reset:**

**1. Gentle movement**
Shake out the day.

**2. Breath work**
Extended exhale (calming).

**3. Body scan**
Release tension.

**4. Gratitude**
3 things your body did today.

**5. Self-touch**
Hand on heart: "You're safe."

---

## Integration & Embodiment

### Healing is Non-Linear

**You won't:**
- Heal in a straight line
- Be "done" one day
- Never feel dysregulated again

**You will:**
- Spiral
- Return to old patterns (sometimes)
- Have good days and hard days
- Gradually increase capacity

**This is normal.**

**This is the path.**

### Integration Timeline

**Weeks 1-4:**
- Learning your nervous system
- Building regulation skills
- Small practices daily

**Months 2-6:**
- Noticing patterns
- Releasing some trauma
- More capacity
- Still challenging

**Months 7-12:**
- Regulation becoming automatic
- Less triggered
- More embodied
- Ongoing practice

**Years 2+:**
- Somatic awareness natural
- Quick regulation
- Living in body
- Trauma still there (but different relationship)

**Healing doesn't mean forgetting.**

**It means:**

Your nervous system learns you're safe now.
