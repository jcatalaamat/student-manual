## Welcome to Death Work

### Death is Your Greatest Teacher

**Not morbid.**

**Not dark.**

**But:**
- The ultimate truth
- The great clarifier
- The doorway
- The teacher

**Death shows you:**
- What matters
- What doesn't
- Who you are
- How to live

### Why Work With Death?

**Because:**
- You will die
- Everyone you love will die
- Avoiding this truth is suffering
- Facing it is freedom
- Death awareness is life awareness

**The fear of death:**
- Runs your life (unconsciously)
- Keeps you small
- Prevents living fully
- Blocks love

**Befriending death:**
- Frees you
- Clarifies
- Deepens life
- Opens love

### What This Workbook Offers

**Not:**
- How to avoid death
- Ways to "transcend" death
- Spiritual bypassing death
- Making death comfortable

**But:**
- Practices for facing mortality
- Tools for death contemplation
- Guidance for the dying
- Living from death awareness
- Death as spiritual practice

---

## Death as Teacher

### What Death Teaches

**Death asks:**

"If you could die tomorrow, how would you live today?"

"What would matter?"

"What wouldn't?"

"Who would you be?"

"What would you say?"

**These questions:**
- Cut through bullshit
- Reveal truth
- Clarify values
- Show what's real

### The Three Messengers

**Buddhist teaching:**

**First messenger:** Sickness
"You will get sick."

**Second messenger:** Old age
"You will grow old."

**Third messenger:** Death
"You will die."

**These are not punishments.**

**These are truths.**

**And they set you free.**

### Death as Clarifier

**When you truly know you'll die:**

**You stop:**
- Pretending
- Performing
- Waiting
- Hiding
- Wasting time

**You start:**
- Being real
- Living now
- Loving fully
- Speaking truth
- Doing what matters

**Death is the ultimate bullshit detector.**

---

## Mortality Contemplation Practices

### Daily Death Meditation

**Morning practice (5-10 min):**

Sit quietly.

**Contemplate:**

"I will die."

Not as concept.

**As truth:**
- This body will stop
- This breath will end
- This life will complete
- One day, maybe soon

**Feel it:**
- In your body
- In your heart
- In your bones

**Don't:**
- Spiral into fear
- Get lost in when/how
- Make it abstract

**Just:**
- Feel the truth
- "I will die"
- Sit with it

**Then:**

"How do I want to live today?"

---

### The Five Remembrances

**Buddhist practice:**

**Daily, recite:**

```
1. I am of the nature to grow old.
   There is no way to escape growing old.

2. I am of the nature to have ill health.
   There is no way to escape ill health.

3. I am of the nature to die.
   There is no way to escape death.

4. All that is dear to me and everyone I love
   are of the nature to change.
   There is no way to escape being separated from them.

5. My actions are my only true belongings.
   I cannot escape the consequences of my actions.
   My actions are the ground upon which I stand.
```

**Sit with each.**

**Feel each.**

**Not to depress.**

**But to clarify.**

---

### Deathbed Visualization

**Weekly practice (15-20 min):**

Close your eyes.

**Imagine:**
- You're on your deathbed
- This is your last day
- You're looking back on your life

**From that place, ask:**

"What mattered?"

"What didn't?"

"What do I wish I'd done?"

"What do I wish I'd said?"

"Who do I wish I'd been?"

"What do I regret?"

"What am I proud of?"

**Write these down.**

**Then:**

"How can I live today to have no regrets then?"

**This is not morbid.**

**This is wisdom.**

---

## Bufo as Death Practice

### Dying Before You Die

**Bufo (5-MeO-DMT) is:**

A death practice.

**You die:**
- Ego dies
- Identity dissolves
- "You" disappears
- Complete dissolution

**And return:**

Having tasted death.

**Knowing:**
- Death is not the end
- "You" were never solid
- Death is a doorway
- Fear can dissolve

### Integration as Death Work

**After Bufo:**

You've died.

**Now:**

How do you live?

**Questions:**

"Having died, how do I want to be alive?"

"What fears died with the ego?"

"What's essential now?"

"How do I live from having died?"

**This is the work.**

### Living Post-Death

**After tasting death:**

**Life might:**
- Feel more precious
- Feel more empty (void)
- Matter more
- Matter less
- Be clarified
- Be confusing

**All normal.**

**Integration is:**

Learning to live having died.

## Grief & Death

### Death Always Brings Grief

**For the dying:**
- Grief for what you're leaving
- Grief for who you'll miss
- Grief for unlived life
- Grief for self

**For the bereaved:**
- Grief for who's gone
- Grief for what won't be
- Grief for self without them

**Both are sacred.**

### Anticipatory Grief

**When you know death is coming:**

Grief begins before death.

**You grieve:**
- In advance
- Alongside the dying
- For what's ending
- For what won't be

**This is normal.**

**This is appropriate.**

**Let it come.**

### Grieving Your Own Death

**If you're dying:**

**You might grieve:**
- Your body
- Your life
- Your people
- Your dreams
- Yourself

**Let this be.**

**Find witnesses:**
- Death doula
- Therapist
- Chaplain
- Loved ones
- Circle

**Grief is part of dying well.**

- Community death
- Ritual
- Preparation
- Witnessing
- Sacred passage

**Now:**

**Bring back:**

**Vigil:**
- Sitting with the dying
- Present until the end
- Witnessing passage

**Preparation of body:**
- Family washes body
- Dress them
- Sit with body
- Say goodbye

**Home funeral (where legal):**
- Body stays home 1-3 days
- People visit
- Stories shared
- Presence with death

**Ritual:**
- Prayer, chant, song
- Sacred space created
- Honoring passage
- Community witness

**Not morbid.**

**Sacred.**

## Dissolving Fear of Death

### The Root Fear

**All fear is:**

Fear of death.

**Fear of:**
- Loss = death of having
- Rejection = social death
- Failure = ego death
- Change = death of known
- Unknown = death of control

**When you face death:**

Other fears lose power.

### Practices for Facing Death Fear

**1. Name it**

"I'm afraid of death."

Out loud.

Feel it.

Where in body?

---

**2. Explore it**

"What am I really afraid of?"

- Pain?
- Nothingness?
- Leaving loved ones?
- Not being remembered?
- Judgment?
- Unknown?

**Name the specific fear.**

---

**3. Sit with it**

Don't try to dissolve fear.

**Just be with it:**
- Feel it
- Breathe with it
- Let it be

**Often:**

Facing fear dissolves it.

---

**4. Contemplate the fear**

"If that happened (painful death, nothingness, etc.), then what?"

"And then what?"

**Follow it to the end.**

Often: Less scary when fully faced.

---

**5. Remember impermanence**

You've already "died" many times:
- Childhood died
- Identities died
- Relationships died
- Old selves died

**You survived.**

**Death is just another ending.**

---

## Living From Death Awareness

### Memento Mori: Remember You Will Die

**Ancient practice:**

Keep death in awareness.

**Not to:**
- Be morbid
- Induce fear
- Be depressed

**But to:**
- Live fully
- Clarify values
- Love deeply
- Stop pretending

### Daily Memento Mori

**Morning:**

Upon waking:
"I might die today."

(Truth. Could happen.)

"How do I want to live this day?"

---

**Evening:**

Before sleep:
"I might not wake up."

(True.)

"Did I live today as I wanted?"

"What do I need to complete?"

---

### Urgency Without Anxiety

**Death awareness gives:**

Urgency (do what matters, now)

**Not:**

Anxiety (desperate clinging)

**The difference:**

**Anxiety:** "I have to do everything perfectly or time will run out!"

**Urgency:** "I don't have forever. Let me do what's true, now."

**One is fear-based.**

**One is love-based.**

### What Death Awareness Changes

**When you truly know you'll die:**

**Relationships:**
- Say "I love you" more
- Let go of grudges
- Spend time with who matters
- Stop tolerating toxic

**Work:**
- Do what's meaningful
- Stop wasting time on bullshit
- Create from soul
- Serve from heart

**Daily life:**
- Savor moments
- Notice beauty
- Feel gratitude
- Be present

**Self:**
- Stop performing
- Be yourself
- Forgive yourself
- Live truthfully

"I will die. How do I want to live?"

## The Death That's Not Death

### Ego Death

**Before physical death:**

Ego can die.

**Ego death:**
- Loss of identity
- Dissolution of self
- "I" disappears

**This can happen through:**
- Meditation
- Plant medicine
- Spiritual emergence
- Life crisis
- Grace

### The Terror of Ego Death

**Ego death feels like:**
- Actual death
- Annihilation
- End of everything

**Because:**

To ego, it IS death.

**But:**

Consciousness continues.

**You don't die.**

**The constructed "you" dies.**

### Living After Ego Death

**After ego death:**

**Life might feel:**
- Empty (void)
- Groundless
- Meaningless
- Free

**Questions:**

"Who am I without ego?"

"How do I live without identity?"

"What matters now?"

**This is:**

The work of integration.

Living from no-self.

(See Workbook 7: The Void)
