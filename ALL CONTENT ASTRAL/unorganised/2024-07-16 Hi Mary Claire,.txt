Hi Mary Claire,I need to talk about what's been happening recently. The message you about banning everyone from the house was really upsetting and made me feel u welcomed, not because I want to be in thst space but because Nina and I have been cleaning after you and supporting you in that home, besides helping you clwan up and throwing unnecessary things to keep the space organised.I’ve always tried to help and support you, and it felt like all of that was overlooked in a very hurtful way.Seeing you yell at and bite Richard in front of me and or beat him has been incredibly shocking and left me feeling scared and unsure how to talk to you. The level of violence I witnessed is something I’m struggling with, and it’s making it hard for me to feel safe around you.What makes it even harder is the way you came back later and acted like nothing happened.Not asking for support or communicating your needs, and then exploding like that, is really confusing and unsettling. It feels like there's no stability or understanding, which makes it difficult to feel safe and welcome.I respect this home and our relationships, but I need to protect my own well-being too. Can we talk about how we can move forward from this? I need to know if you explicitly want us to leave because my partner and I want to stay and support you, but we need clear communication and a safe environment to do that.I hope we can work through this and create a better atmosphere for everyone.Best,
