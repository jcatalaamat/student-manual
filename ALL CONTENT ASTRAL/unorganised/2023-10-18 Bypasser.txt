Bypasser TriggerListenerUnderstanding your egoYour woundYour lack of self worthListening to the undercurrentThe under worldLiberating myselfFrom the horrorThat I livedAnd my ancestors livedLiving a beautiful lifeGrateful for the chance of being hereBirthed by my motherAnd my fatherInto this realm of loveAhoThank youThank youThank you
