Table comparing both offers and % of fine or loan if delay, also if Carlos would invest 150? And make every person 150k max until 600k, put the 6% out but countedLand value was 20, offered to us to 15. We downed it to 12 but 6% of the 12 has to be paid extra by us, some 1 million. 12 million pesos is 600k usd, so 1 million is probably more than 6%?Anyway, that's what it isI need one offer which is 12 million in 6 months, minus 50k deposit, 200-250 on first payment and 300-350 second. One in  3 months one in 6.Expredd this in a table here inline
