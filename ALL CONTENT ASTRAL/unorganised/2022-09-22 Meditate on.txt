Meditate on • the energy of being in abundance and relaxed and happy• The energy of being in joy and releasing the weight in the body, shoulders, and voice• How would I be if I was embodied and wouldn't look at people in the street?• Is it OK that when there's more sex in the energy of the space where I am I am more sexual with my partner and so if there is more darkness I'm more upset and angry and ready to argue with my partner and should that be like that and I should be fine with it? Allowing all energies to define who I am in the moment with no problem or control?• What would happen if I would be able to send voice messages in presence in front of anyone?
