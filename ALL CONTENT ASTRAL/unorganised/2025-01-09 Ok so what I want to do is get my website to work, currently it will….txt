Ok so what I want to do is get my website to work, currently it will show different errors, and also I want to scrap everything thats not necessary for the basic site that tamagui.dev used to have, but I don't need animations, etc, login, etc, but I want to keep for now all the UI as it is (except for the animations and these sort of complex things) but I wanna keep the search (or at least part of it) and I want to keep the theme change from dark to light, etc, so I dont wanna touch much of this. I am trying to reach a point where I can install dependencies and the app works, which currently it does not. So yes we can delete safely whatever seems super backend but I need to make sure the docs page remains intact and everything data related or simple stuff for the home page, also the docs are supposeddly trying to run some components, which not sure I need, documentation would be nice to keep as simple as possible, but i liked that there were sections and so on, but not sure how to make it simplified. also i forgot to say I want to publish this to github pages
