Kero's tail was shining in deep rainbow colors, purple green blue pink green yellow redAnd the tail was like the one of a phoenix. During sunset. Climbing up the mountain I was there breathing with him in his last moments. Coming up from the deep cave of loneliness. He was onside a bag and he had peed himself. He still awoke and came back one more time from the dead to give me one more chance to be with him.This was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. The life and the colors. The vibrancy he had and the timing with his own death.This was after the storm had passed and we had figured out how to use our powers. After the old glastonburian lady had come out of the dark and had said never more. It was her time and it was our time.This happened after we figured out how to use our rainbow power and the darkest storm had passed and I had screamed and became the storm itself, merging with it at the sound of the thunder.My sweet dear Kero. Thank you for coming back from the depths of the underworld to raise above the colors of the mountain sun.
