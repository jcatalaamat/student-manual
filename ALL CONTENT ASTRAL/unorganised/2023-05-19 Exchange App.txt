Exchange App&quotI'm planning to develop a web and mobile application using React Native, Node.js, TypeScript, and a suitable database system. The application will serve as a platform for the exchange of services within the local community of Mallorca, with a focus on holistic therapies, arts, and other skills.The user experience should be intuitive and user-friendly. The registration process should be straightforward, leading to a profile creation step where users can describe their skills and services. The main features of the platform should include user authentication, profile management, service listing and browsing, a trading system, a transaction management system, and a user feedback or rating system.The trading system will be a crucial feature. It should be built with the capacity to handle service exchanges as well as monetary transactions. For this, we are considering using Ethereum smart contracts to create a unique token for our platform. The token will represent value within our ecosystem and could be traded for services.In addition to these features, the platform should have a messaging system that allows users to communicate directly, ensuring smooth coordination of service exchanges. The database system should be scalable and flexible. MongoDB could be a good fit due to these properties, or we could consider PostgreSQL for a more robust SQL solution.The platform will place emphasis on holistic therapies and arts, which could have their own categories in the service listings. Community members can list their specific therapeutic skills, art offerings, or other services, and users can book these services using our platform's tokens.From a marketing perspective, we'll reach out to our local community through networking events, partnerships with local businesses and artists, and targeted social media campaigns. We'll also consider implementing a referral program to incentivize user growth.While the platform is inherently local, supporting the economy of Mallorca, we'll minimize the emphasis on sustainability initially due to the small scale of the project. However, we aim to promote fair and equitable trading practices.Could you help me build this project, providing advice and solutions based on your expertise in React Native, web development, Node.js, TypeScript, databases, blockchain, digital currencies, holistic therapies, community development, and marketing?
