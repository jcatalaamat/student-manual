The journey is going to be organic, erratic, ready to evolve and extremely transformative.We'll meet weekly, every Thursday, for up to 2 hours. I will be open for questions, requests, and we will discuss healing and self liberation.Will I see you there?Much love x--I guide them through a journey of coming back to themselves and healing the aspects of them.Meditation journey to bring self awareness and self enquiry and bringing healing into their bodies and spiritual selves.Guiding them through a visualisation where they can let go of their story and release their trauma through finding the truth of themselves.-An hour dropping experience into the true self to let go, unwind, recharge, and heal.Come ready to merge with the infinite. To become one with stillness. To feel the impermanence of time through your heart.
