Hi Emma,Hope you’re doing well!I just wanted to check in about the invoice I sent on September 30th. It would be really helpful if payment could be made by the end of this week, if possible.If there’s any delay or issue, just let me know, and we can figure it out.Thanks so much for your help!Best,Jordi
