Weekly Review Process**Purpose:** Reflect on your past week, assess your progress, adjust your plans, and prepare for the upcoming week.**Steps for a Weekly Review:**1. **Set a Consistent Time:** Pick a specific time each week (e.g., Sunday afternoon) and block it out in your calendar. Make it a ritual that feels good—perhaps with a cup of tea or your favorite music.   2. **Use a Review Template:**   - **Wins and Accomplishments:** List what went well this week. Celebrate small victories like finishing a task, taking a needed break, or managing a tough situation.   - **Challenges and Obstacles:** Note any struggles or blocks. Reflect on why these happened without judgment.   - **Adjustments for Next Week:** Decide on any changes or focus areas for the coming week. Consider shifting tasks from “Later” if they feel more relevant now.   - **“Later” List Review:** Quickly scan your “Later” list. Move a couple of tasks to “Today” if they align with your next week’s priorities.3. **Retrospective Questions:**   - What energized me this week?   - What drained me, and how can I manage it differently?   - What’s one thing I want to start, stop, and continue?### 2. Managing Daily To-Do Lists with “Later”**Daily Task Management:**- **Keep It Simple:** Have one main list for “Today” tasks and a small section for “Later.” - **Daily Review:** At the start of your day, look at the “Later” section briefly. If anything feels right to tackle today, move it to “Today.” Otherwise, leave it be.**Using “Later” Lists Effectively:**- Think of “Later” as a gentle holding place for ideas and tasks that don’t have urgency. It’s okay for items to stay there without action; it’s more about having them captured.- For recurring thoughts or ideas, keep a master “Later” list. Use your weekly review to sift through and bring forward anything that feels timely.### 3. Visual Representations and Emergency Cards**Mind Maps:**- Use a tool like Miro or a simple sketchbook. Create central themes (e.g., “Work,” “Personal,” “Health”) and branch out into tasks or sub-areas. Keep it fluid and don’t worry about perfection—just capture what feels right.  **Emergency Cards for Freak-Out Moments:**- **Design Approach:**   - Focus on function: What do you need to remember when you’re overwhelmed? Examples: “Breathe,” “Step outside,” “Drink water.”  - Use Miro, Canva, or sticky notes. Create very basic, readable cards—keep them visually soothing or fun.  - **Keep Them Accessible:** Place them in your workspace, on your phone, or anywhere easily visible.### 4. Organizing Notes and Action Plans**Consolidate Your Notes:**- Choose one main platform (Notion, Evernote, a physical binder) to collect all your notes and wisdom.- Create broad categories like “Wisdom,” “Healing,” “Action Plans,” etc. Keep it simple at first.**Tagging and Organization:**- Use tags to help filter your notes. For example, tags like #healing, #ideas, #action can make it easier to find related content later.**Periodic Sorting:**- Set a brief time once a week or month to go through some notes. Highlight key takeaways or actionable steps. Archive anything that feels like it’s no longer relevant.### Visual Planning and Consistency- **Miro Board Example:**  - **Sections:** “This Week,” “Next Week,” “Someday,” and “Wins.”  - Use sticky notes or digital notes for each task or idea.  - Keep it flexible: Move tasks around as needed without pressure to keep a perfect layout.Would you like help setting up any specific templates or further guidance on how to keep these systems working for you?
