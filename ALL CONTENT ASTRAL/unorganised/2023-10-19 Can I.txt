Can IBreath in the realms of ascensionAnd live in the arms of your attentionCan ITranscend what no longer allows me toCreate the love I truly desireLive a life full of creationAscend to the arms of spiritAllow myself to rebirthIs it now timeTo be grateful for the times whereIt all felt lostAnd I stand stillIn the midst of the stormThe chaos that reignsThe darkest nights of the soulLabrynths that engulf you to the deepest rivers of hellAnd deathAnd rebirthAs the oneWho came here to be the guideAs the oneWho came here to enlighten the soulsWho chose to awakenI amThat I amI amThat I am
