Ja quan el solSurt Pel matiJa no se’l veu comAbans.Ja no es la mateixa enlluernorCom feia els dies d’hivernNi la pluja d’estiu ja noEs fortaJa no es res, la raó ni el sentimentDe la vida del passatTot ja es platejatEn un canvi de mirallsDe vida i de tristorL’aventura de la fillaDe la terra de l’aireJa es aquíCom una tardor i una fullaQue cau profundament dinsD’un riuDe llum i de foscorEn un dia ennuvolatDe no gaire tristorArti: Certainly! Here's a modified version that retains much of the original sentiment with just a few tweaks:&quotWhen the sun Rises in the morning, It doesn't look the sameAs before.Its brilliance isn't as It was in the winter days,Nor the summer rain Is strong anymore.The reason and sentimentOf past lifeAre nothing anymore.Everything has been silvered In a change of mirrors Of life and sadness.The adventure of the daughter Of earth and air Is already here.Like an autumn and a leaf That falls deeply Into a river.Of light and darkness,On a cloudy day,Not much sadness remains.&quot The minor changes were made to help the rhythm of the poem flow more naturally and coherently in English. The spirit and main ideas of your original poem, however, remain largely the same.
