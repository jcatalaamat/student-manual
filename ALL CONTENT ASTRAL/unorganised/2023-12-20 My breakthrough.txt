My breakthroughI stopped watching IG Stories.I realised how much dopamine they were giving me. The thrill of opening to something awesome!Now I don't use Instagram except for watching memes, and that is all.Now, seriously.This week has been an absolute piece of bumbum.I had to treat my cats with a greater discipline to make sure they are not coming in the house or scratching the door constantly.My nervous system in on the edge of the edges. My child is getting on me. She's challenging and she is very alive.I have given my projects to God. I am putting the signs for people to find my places for those who have to be there. It feels it's something like Noah's ark, without the hole genocide.I have realised how much the energies in the Middle East are inflicting psychic pain in our consciousness. I have to detach and clear constantly not to feel the pain and hatred coming from there, the media, and the collective consciousness.I keep clearing my past. It's become a much easier journey. I had a great healing in my MIT course, and that allowed for some fears and energies to be lifted. Now I can observe without feeling like they are going to eat me. I can pick up wood without being murdered energetically (seriously this has been a process for the last 2 months)BreakdownI can feel the pain in my neck, my shoulders, and I am unable to move. I am challenged to create routine and discipline and yet routine and discipline are not here yet.I can feel the generations in my ribs, in my lungs, in many other places.I am bursting in kundalini in here.And it feels horribly horrible.I don't know what is supposed to stay after a full on kundalini awakening, I sometimes fear I will not make it. Will I survive?
