Always same with women. It’s when they want not when I want.She’s never going to do the first step.She is doing it to manipulate me -&gt I give in to threesomes -&gt I please to exchange for somethingI’m not good enough for me to receive this -&gt love in such form that would make me happy past breakthroughI self sabotage before getting what I want / or are aligned withI fail to remain at my parents levelI kidnap the space in order to withhold love and punish people around mePeople don’t ask me what I want or know about the situation that would unlock the situation or bring a bright perspective to observe and communicate.I get ahead of myself to confuse and hurt othersPeople give me for granted because I am a Yes -&gt I am starving for love -&gt I don’t know I matter -&gt this helps me matterI have a love/hate relationship with my loved one/sI won’t sing until my mum and I are connected / until I make peace with motherI am inherently wrong. Every decision I make is wrong. Everything I do is inquisitively questionable and non-forgivable and punishing.What is bad about loving yourself? -&gt I’m afraid I will not need Nina -&gt I will want to make love and kiss everyone -&gt I cannot live without Nina -&gt I will die of hunger -&gt Love yourself through food -&gt what do I need? -&gt can I get it? -&gt I need to love myself -&gt through cooking -&gt food -&gt everything is SOLVEDWhat am I so shameful about being joyous? I’m going to have to give my penis away to the people I loveMy mum sucked my dick -&gt I wish she had done it again -&gt I wish I’d remember -&gt I hate her for not teaching me to remember -&gt How to love and take care of her -&gt I miss making love to my mum -&gt what was making love? -&gt I need to be rewarded to do things -&gt why? -&gt Do I take care of myself or project that she will despite how she may feel? -&gtIf it would have been fine we would have done it by now -&gt proves me I was wrong -&gt I am wrong -&gt I cannot be loving because I don’t see my partner being loving -&gt that’s what makes me have to go in their back -&gt I don’t seem to see my partner getting close to the person and so I feel like my exciting and energy won’t be welcomed since I fear it’s better than hers so I give for granted she doesn’t like the other person which she prives me by not doing anything and complaining when I do and she’s not there. But non of us is both of us there and do something. At least I try behind the back to make something happen -&gt no one takes responsibility for what they feel -&gt I feel like I have no choice because they haven’t explained me well their process -&gt I’m a child I cannot ask if I ask is worseThe moment is broken. I cannot recover what was supposed to be. I won’t have a new star with this person anymore. Its tainted. Rape. Throw away. I cannot have my love story. The one on the books. If I hadn’t kissed her when I did we would have kissed after together and this we can never do again. Its broken. I will always have been the bad one that broke the start if our connection. :( :’( -&gt
