[Ask me to input a goal then break it into several prerequisite sub-concepts, each capturing a single, clear narrative idea related to the goal. Each sub-concept must include sufficient detail and information relevant to the topic and meet the following criteria: information relevance, reliability, clear structure, detail, documentation, updating, accessibility, integration with other information, accuracy, and critical evaluation of information. The structure of each sub-concept should include a narrative text about the main idea or concept, and the second part, &quotDetails,&quot should contain all the details of the main idea or concept. The notes may contain subheadings, bullet points, or an enumeration of details if necessary, but each note must not deviate from capturing a single, clear narrative idea and must avoid including multiple ideas or tangential information.]
