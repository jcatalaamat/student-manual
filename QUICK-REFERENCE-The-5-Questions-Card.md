## üéØ PURPOSE

The 5 Questions help you dig to the ROOT of any pattern, wound, or trigger.

**Use these instead of asking "WHY" (which keeps you in victim mode).**

These questions keep you objective and systematic.

---

## üìù THE 5 SACRED QUESTIONS

### 1. WHAT did you feel when this happened?

**Not:** What did you think?
**Ask:** What was the FEELING? (anger, sadness, fear, shame, etc.)

**Go deeper:**
- What was underneath that feeling?
- And what was underneath THAT?
- Keep asking "What else did I feel?"

---

### 2. WHO made you feel that way?

**Not:** Whose fault was it?
**Ask:** Who was involved in the situation?

**Go deeper:**
- Who else was there?
- Who did this person remind you of?
- Who else has made you feel this way?

---

### 3. HOW did it happen?

**Not:** Why did it happen?
**Ask:** What were the specific events/actions?

**Go deeper:**
- How exactly did it unfold?
- What happened first, then next?
- How did your body respond?

---

### 4. WHEN did it happen?

**Not:** Just the recent trigger
**Ask:** When did you FIRST feel this way?

**Go deeper:**
- How old were you?
- What else was happening in your life then?
- When have you felt this exact same way since?

---

### 5. WHERE did this happen?

**Not:** Just physical location
**Ask:** What was the environment/context?

**Go deeper:**
- What did the space feel like?
- Where in your body do you feel it?
- Where else have you experienced this pattern?

---

## üåä GOING DEEPER - ESSENTIAL FOLLOW-UPS

After answering all 5 questions, ask:

### "What's underneath that?"
**Keep asking this until you can't go deeper.**

### "And then what happened?"
**Follow the thread forward in time.**

### "And how did that make you feel?"
**Always return to the FEELING.**

### "And what did you believe about yourself because of that?"
**Uncover the core belief formed.**

### "And where else did you feel that?"
**Find the pattern across your life.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDERS

### ‚ùå DON'T STOP TOO SOON
"When you think you've reached the bottom, GO DEEPER."

The mind will try to convince you you're done before you actually are.

### ‚úÖ SIGNS YOU'VE REACHED THE BOTTOM:
- Natural release (crying, shaking, sighing)
- Sudden calm or spaciness
- Can't remember what you were digging on
- Feeling of "completion" in the body
- Physical tension releases
- Deep peace settles in

### ‚ùå SIGNS YOU STOPPED TOO SOON:
- Intellectual understanding but no emotional release
- Still triggered by the pattern
- Rushed to finish
- Decided with your mind "I'm done"
- Still feeling charge in the body

## üö´ RED FLAGS: BYPASSING

You're bypassing if you:
- ‚úó Stop after 5-10 minutes ("I'm done!")
- ‚úó Intellectualize instead of feel
- ‚úó Immediately feel "better" without release
- ‚úó Distract yourself mid-session
- ‚úó Jump to solutions/fixes
- ‚úó Blame others instead of feeling your feelings
- ‚úó Spiritual bypass ("It's all love!")
- ‚úó Decide you're "ready" to stop (vs. natural completion)

---

## ‚úÖ DIGGING WORK BEST PRACTICES

‚úÖ Keep asking "What's underneath?"
‚úÖ Return to the 5 questions multiple times
‚úÖ Feel in your body, not just think
‚úÖ Go back to earliest memory of this feeling
‚úÖ Trust the natural unfolding
‚úÖ Allow whatever comes up
‚úÖ Take breaks if genuinely needed

### DON'T:
‚ùå Ask "WHY" during systematic digging (use it later for victim consciousness exploration)

‚ùå Bypass with understanding
‚ùå Stop when you intellectually "get it"

## üíé COMBINING WITH FEELING WORK

**The 5 Questions** (Module 11) work best when combined with **The Art of FEELING** (Module 10):

1. Use the 5 Questions to LOCATE the wound
2. Use Feeling Work to RELEASE the wound
3. Alternate between questioning and feeling
4. Don't just answer intellectually - FEEL each answer

**Remember:** The questions are the MAP.
Feeling is the VEHICLE.

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

**"I can't remember when it first happened"**
‚Üí That's okay. Go with your earliest memory, or work with body sensation.

**"Nothing is coming up"**
‚Üí You might not be ready yet. Try a different pattern, or return to this later.

**"I keep circling the same answers"**
‚Üí You're close! Push through one more layer. Ask "What's UNDERNEATH that?"

**"I feel like I've gone deep enough"**
‚Üí That's your mind talking. Go ONE layer deeper.

**"This is too painful"**
‚Üí You can pause. But know: you CAN'T heal with the bullet still inside.

---
