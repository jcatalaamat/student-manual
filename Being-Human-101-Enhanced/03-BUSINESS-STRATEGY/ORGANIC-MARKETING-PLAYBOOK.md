# ORGANIC MARKETING PLAYBOOK
## How to Grow Without Ads (Instagram, Pinterest, Email, Word of Mouth)

**For:** People who hate paid ads and want to build organically
**Timeline:** 6-12 months to $60-100K/year
**Investment:** $522/year (tools only, no ad spend)

---

## 🎯 THE ORGANIC GROWTH FORMULA

```
VALUABLE CONTENT (daily)
    ↓
ENGAGED AUDIENCE (follows you)
    ↓
EMAIL LIST (owns relationship)
    ↓
PRODUCT SALES (organic conversion)
    ↓
WORD OF MOUTH (customers share)
    ↓
REPEAT (flywheel spins)
```

**Key Insight:** Organic is SLOW but SUSTAINABLE. You're building a real audience who loves your work, not buying attention.

---

## 📱 PLATFORM #1: INSTAGRAM/TIKTOK (PRIMARY)

### **Why This Works:**

- Spiritual/personal growth content performs WELL on IG/TikTok
- Shadow work, manifestation, healing = millions of views
- You can grow 10K+ followers in 6-12 months (realistic)
- Free traffic to your products

---

### **CONTENT STRATEGY (POST DAILY)**

#### **Content Pillars (Rotate Through These):**

**Pillar 1: Education (Teach Your Work)**
- What is shadow work?
- The Shadow Integration Protocol explained
- How to identify projections
- Dark journaling tutorial

**Formats:**
- Reels (60-90 sec teaching)
- Carousels (10 slides breaking down concept)
- Stories (quick tips, behind-the-scenes)

**Example Reel:**
```
Hook: "This is what shadow work actually is (not what TikTok says)"
→ 60 seconds explaining shadow work accurately
→ CTA: "Link in bio for free Shadow Work Starter Guide"
```

**Pillar 2: Transformation Stories**
- Your shadow work journey
- Client transformations (with permission)
- Before/after mindset shifts

**Example Carousel:**
```
Slide 1: "6 months ago I was..."
Slide 2-5: Struggles (people-pleasing, anger suppression, etc.)
Slide 6-9: Shadow work process
Slide 10: "Now I'm..." (transformation)
CTA: "Want this? Link in bio for my program"
```

**Pillar 3: Relatability (You're Human Too)**
- Your current struggles
- What you're working through
- Vulnerable shares

**Example Reel:**
```
"POV: You're a shadow work teacher but your inner critic still says you're not enough"
→ Relatable, funny, vulnerable
→ Builds trust (you're not perfect either)
```

**Pillar 4: Calls to Action (Sell Your Work)**
- Launch announcements
- Product tours
- Testimonial shares
- Limited-time offers

**Example:**
```
Carousel showing inside your Notion template
"This is the Shadow Work Kit I wish I had 5 years ago"
10 slides showing each section
Slide 10: "Get it for $47 (link in bio)"
```

---

### **POSTING RHYTHM (DAILY):**

**Option A (High Volume):**
- 1 Reel/day (education or transformation)
- 1 Carousel/day (teaching)
- 5-10 Stories/day (behind-the-scenes, polls, Q&A)

**Option B (Sustainable):**
- 1 Reel every other day
- 1 Carousel 3x/week
- 3-5 Stories/day

**Batch Create:**
- Film 5-7 Reels in one sitting (Sunday)
- Design 5-7 Carousels in Canva (Monday)
- Schedule with Later or Planoly
- Daily: Just show up for Stories

---

### **GROWTH TACTICS (ORGANIC):**

**1. Hook + Value + CTA Formula**
- Hook (first 3 seconds): Scroll-stopping statement
  - "Your shadow holds your power"
  - "You're not healing wrong, you're bypassing"
  - "This is why you keep attracting the same people"
- Value (next 60 seconds): Teach something useful
- CTA (last 5 seconds): "Link in bio for free guide"

**2. Trending Audios (Reels)**
- Use trending sounds (even if not perfectly aligned)
- Algorithm boosts trending audio usage
- Add shadow work twist to trending meme

**3. Carousels (Best for Saves)**
- "10 Shadow Work Prompts to Try Tonight"
- "The Shadow Integration Protocol Explained"
- "5 Signs You're Bypassing Your Shadow"
- Saves = Algorithm loves it = More reach

**4. Engagement Loops**
- Ask questions in captions
- "What's your biggest shadow work struggle? Comment below"
- Reply to EVERY comment (engagement signals)
- DM conversations = relationship building

**5. Collaborations**
- Duet/Stitch other creators' videos
- Collaborate with other healers/coaches (not competitors, complementary)
- Guest on their Stories, they guest on yours

---

### **LINK IN BIO STRATEGY:**

**Don't just link to Instagram profile. Use a link-in-bio tool:**

**Beacons/Linktree/Stan Store Setup:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
YOUR NAME - Shadow Work Teacher
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[FREE] Shadow Work Starter Guide
→ Email opt-in

[SHOP] Shadow Work Kit ($47)
→ Notion template + PDFs

[JOIN] Inner Ascend Membership ($27/mo)
→ Monthly practices + community

[LEARN] Being Human 101 Certification ($997)
→ Train to facilitate

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Every post CTA:** "Link in bio for [specific thing]"

---

## 📌 PLATFORM #2: PINTEREST (PASSIVE TRAFFIC GOLDMINE)

### **Why Pinterest is INSANE for Organic:**

- Pinterest is a SEARCH ENGINE (not social media)
- Your pins get found YEARS later (not 24 hours like Instagram)
- Shadow work, personal growth, spiritual content = HUGE on Pinterest
- Drives traffic to blog → email opt-in → sales

**How It Works:**
1. Create blog post: "What is Shadow Work? (Complete Guide)"
2. Create 5-10 pins for that one blog post (different images/text)
3. Pin them to Pinterest
4. People search "shadow work" → Find your pin → Click to blog → Enter email for free guide
5. Email sequence sells your products

---

### **PINTEREST STRATEGY:**

**Content to Create:**

**Blog Posts (SEO-optimized):**
- "What is Shadow Work? (Complete Beginner's Guide)"
- "The Shadow Integration Protocol Explained"
- "50 Shadow Work Journal Prompts"
- "How to Start a Business in 90 Days (Step-by-Step)"
- "Business Launch Checklist (Free Download)"

**One blog post = traffic for YEARS.**

**Pin Design (Canva):**
- Vertical (1000 × 1500px)
- Bold text overlay: "What is Shadow Work?"
- Eye-catching image (dark, mystical vibes for shadow work)
- Your logo/brand
- Create 5-10 pin variations for each blog post

**Pinning Rhythm:**
- 5-10 pins/day (schedule with Tailwind)
- Repin your old pins (keep them circulating)
- Pin to relevant boards ("Shadow Work," "Personal Growth," "Healing")

---

### **PINTEREST → EMAIL → SALES FUNNEL:**

```
1. USER SEARCHES: "shadow work prompts"

2. FINDS YOUR PIN: "50 Shadow Work Prompts"

3. CLICKS TO BLOG POST: Your website

4. BLOG POST HAS OPT-IN:
   "Want all 50 prompts as a printable PDF?
    Enter email below"

5. EMAIL CAPTURED → Enters funnel

6. EMAIL SEQUENCE (7 days):
   Day 1: Deliver PDF + intro to you
   Day 2: Shadow work story
   Day 3: Introduce Shadow Work Kit ($47)
   Day 5: Testimonial + urgency
   Day 7: Last chance

7. SALES HAPPEN (10% convert)
```

**Result:** Passive traffic while you sleep. Pinterest pins work 24/7/365.

---

## 📧 PLATFORM #3: EMAIL (THE MONEY IS IN THE LIST)

### **Why Email is KING:**

- You OWN the list (not Instagram's algorithm)
- Email converts 10-20% (vs. 1-3% on social)
- Direct line to your people
- Can sell anytime

---
