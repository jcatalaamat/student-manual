# HOW MANY PRODUCTS SHOULD YOU BUILD?
## The Product Ladder Strategy (Not Too Few, Not Too Many)

**The Question:** "Should I build 1 product or 20 products?"

**The Answer:** Build **4-7 products** in a strategic ladder (free → low → mid → high-ticket).

**Why NOT just 1 product?**
- Leaves money on the table (some people want more, will pay more)
- No upsell path (buyer journey ends after one purchase)
- Revenue ceiling (can only make so much at one price point)

**Why NOT 20 products?**
- Overwhelming for customers (decision fatigue)
- Dilutes marketing (can't focus message)
- Maintenance nightmare (updating 20 products constantly)

**The Sweet Spot: 4-7 products in an ASCENSION MODEL**
