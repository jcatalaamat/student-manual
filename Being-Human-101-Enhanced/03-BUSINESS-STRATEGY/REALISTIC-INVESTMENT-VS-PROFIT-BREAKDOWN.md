# REALISTIC INVESTMENT VS. PROFIT BREAKDOWN
## Actual Numbers: What You'll Spend vs. What You'll Make (No BS)

**The Truth:** Most "make $100K in 3 months!" advice is bullshit. Here's what ACTUALLY happens when you build digital products or apps, with real investment numbers and realistic timelines.

---

## 🎯 THE THREE PATHS (COMPARED)

### **Path 1: Web Products (Organic Marketing)**
### **Path 2: Web Products (Paid Ads)**
### **Path 3: Mobile App (Co-Star Style)**

---

## 💰 PATH 1: WEB PRODUCTS + ORGANIC MARKETING

**Your Situation:** You don't want to run ads, you prefer organic (social media, Pinterest, word of mouth)

### **INVESTMENT BREAKDOWN**

#### **Upfront Costs (One-Time):**
- Carrd (landing pages): $19/year
- Canva Pro (design): $155/year
- Total: **$174** (under $200!)

#### **Monthly Costs:**
- ConvertKit (email - 1,000 subs): $29/mo
- Gumroad (product delivery): 10% of sales (no monthly fee)
- Total: **$29/month**

#### **Time Investment:**
- Create first product: 3-7 days (Being Human 101 Workbook as Notion template + PDFs)
- Build landing page: 1 day (Carrd)
- Set up email funnel: 2 days
- Total: **1-2 weeks to launch**

#### **Content Creation (Ongoing):**
- Instagram posts: 30 min/day (reels, carousels about shadow work)
- Pinterest pins: 1 hour/week (pins to blog posts → opt-in)
- Email newsletter: 2 hours/week
- Total: **~1 hour/day**

**Total Investment Year 1:** $174 + ($29 × 12) = **$522**

---

### **REVENUE (ORGANIC ONLY - REALISTIC)**

**Month 1-3 (Building Audience):**
- You post daily on Instagram about shadow work
- You pin on Pinterest (Being Human 101 content)
- You capture 50-100 emails/month organically
- Month 3 total: 200 emails

**Revenue:** 200 emails × 5% conversion × $47 product = **$470**
**Profit:** $470 - $87 (3 months costs) = **$383**

---

**Month 4-6 (Growing):**
- Consistent posting, audience growing
- 200-300 new emails/month
- Month 6 total: 1,000 emails

**Revenue:** 1,000 emails × 10% conversion × $47 = **$4,700**
**Profit:** $4,700 - $174 (costs) = **$4,526**

---

**Month 7-12 (Momentum):**
- Word of mouth kicking in
- 300-500 new emails/month
- Month 12 total: 4,000 emails

**Revenue:** 4,000 emails × 10% × $47 = **$18,800**
**Plus:** Upsells to $97 course (5% of buyers) = $2,350
**Total Month 12 Revenue:** **$21,150**

**Year 1 Total Revenue:** ~$60,000-80,000
**Year 1 Total Costs:** $522
**Year 1 Profit:** **$59,478 - $79,478**

**ROI:** 11,438% (invest $522, make $60K-80K)

---

### **EFFORT VS. REWARD (ORGANIC):**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Almost no financial investment ($522/year)
- ✅ You control everything (no ads, no platform risk)
- ✅ Builds real audience (people who love your work)
- ✅ Sustainable (not dependent on ad costs)
- ✅ Feels aligned (you're creating content you'd create anyway)

**Cons:**
- ❌ SLOW (takes 6-12 months to hit momentum)
- ❌ Requires daily content creation (1 hr/day)
- ❌ Ceiling is lower (unless you go viral, growth is steady but slow)
- ❌ Revenue is unpredictable month-to-month

**Best For You If:**
- ✅ You don't want to spend money on ads
- ✅ You're okay with slower growth
- ✅ You enjoy creating content (Instagram, Pinterest, writing)
- ✅ You're building for long-term (not quick cash grab)

---

## 💰 PATH 2: WEB PRODUCTS + PAID ADS

**Your Situation:** You're willing to invest in ads to grow faster

### **INVESTMENT BREAKDOWN**

#### **Upfront Costs (Same as Organic):**
- Carrd + Canva: $174/year
- ConvertKit: $29/mo

#### **Ad Spend:**
- Month 1 (Testing): $500-1,000
- Month 2 (Optimizing): $1,000-2,000
- Month 3+ (Scaling): $3,000-10,000/mo

**Total Investment Year 1:**
- Tools: $522
- Ads (conservative): $30,000
- **Total: $30,522**

---

### **REVENUE (PAID ADS - REALISTIC)**

**Month 1 (Testing, $1,000 ad spend):**
- 300 landing page visits
- 30 buyers (10% conversion)
- 30 × $47 = $1,410
- Plus email follow-up: 20 more sales = $940
- **Total: $2,350**
- **Profit:** $2,350 - $1,000 ads - $29 tools = **$1,321**

**Month 2-3 (Optimizing, $2,000/mo ad spend):**
- Better targeting, retargeting set up
- 600 visits, 60 buyers = $2,820
- Email follow-up: $1,880
- **Total per month: $4,700**
- **Profit:** $4,700 - $2,000 ads - $29 = **$2,671/month**

**Month 4-6 (Scaling, $5,000/mo ad spend):**
- Winning ad found, scaling
- 1,500 visits, 150 buyers = $7,050
- Email follow-up: $4,700
- **Total per month: $11,750**
- **Profit:** $11,750 - $5,000 ads - $29 = **$6,721/month**

**Month 7-12 (Scaled, $10,000/mo ad spend):**
- 3,000 visits, 300 buyers = $14,100
- Email follow-up: $9,400
- Upsells to $97 course: $4,700
- **Total per month: $28,200**
- **Profit:** $28,200 - $10,000 ads - $29 = **$18,171/month**

**Year 1 Total Revenue:** ~$180,000
**Year 1 Total Costs:** $30,522 (tools + ads)
**Year 1 Profit:** **$149,478**

**ROI:** 490% (invest $30K, make $150K)

---

### **EFFORT VS. REWARD (PAID ADS):**

**Pros:**
- ✅ FAST (Month 3 you're at $5K/mo profit)
- ✅ Scalable (more ad spend = more profit, linearly)
- ✅ Predictable (you know: $1 ad spend = $2-3 revenue)
- ✅ Less content creation (ads do the work, not daily posts)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires upfront capital ($5K-30K)
- ❌ Risk (if ads don't convert, you lose money)
- ❌ Platform dependence (Facebook bans you = business dies)
- ❌ Ad fatigue (need to refresh creative constantly)
- ❌ Feels less aligned (paying for attention vs. earning it)

**Best For You If:**
- ✅ You have $5K-30K to invest
- ✅ You want fast results (3-6 months to profit)
- ✅ You're okay with risk
- ✅ You don't enjoy daily content creation

- Hired: $30K-50K revenue - $20K-40K = **-$10K to +$30K** (might lose money Year 1)

**ROI:**
