## 🎯 RECOMMENDED STRATEGY: PHASED APPROACH

**Don't pick just ONE. Do them in PHASES:**

### **PHASE 1 (THIS WEEK): Notion Template**

- **Price:** $147
- **Goal:** 200 sales = $29,400
- **Upsell:** Notion buyers can upgrade to full course

### **PHASE 3 (MONTH 3): Membership**
- **Why:** Recurring revenue, community
- **Build:** Add monthly practices, live calls
- **Price:** $27/mo
- **Goal:** 100 members = $32,400/year

## 💡 MY FINAL RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU

**Start with OPTION 1 (Notion Template) THIS WEEK:**

**Why:**
1. **Speed:** Launch TODAY (format content, share link, done)
2. **Cost:** $0 (just your time)
3. **Validation:** See if people will pay for Being Human 101
4. **Quick cash:** $47 × 100 users = $4,700 (fund next phases)
5. **No risk:** If it flops, you wasted 1 day (not 6 months)

**Then:**
- If 100+ people buy Notion template → Build web course (Phase 2)
- If 200+ buy course → Add membership (Phase 3)
- If membership works → Build app (Phase 4)

**Each phase validates the next. Each phase funds the next.**

**Don't spend 6 months building an app if no one wants the content.**

**Test with Notion first. Then iterate.** 🚀
