# MODULE 2: CORE WOUNDS
## The Mum and Dad Wounds. Anchors and Your Big WHY

**Part 1: Foundations | Week 2 | Duration: 5-7 days of deep work**

---

## WELCOME TO MODULE 2

This is where it gets personal.

We're going to talk about your relationship with your parents. We're going to examine the deepest woundsthe ones that have shaped everything else.

This isn't about blame. This isn't about making them wrong.

**This is about understanding the neural pathways that were carved into you during your most formative years.**

These core woundsthese mum and dad woundsare the foundation upon which most of your other patterns were built. To reach the root, you will likely need to traverse these pathways repeatedly.

**And because this work is hard**, because your mind will fight you every step of the way, we're also going to create your **Anchors**points of truth you can return to when the journey gets rough.

And we're going to discover your **Big WHY**the deeper purpose that will sustain you when you want to quit.

---

## CORE TEACHINGS

### WHAT ARE CORE WOUNDS?

These wounds are what we call **your core wounds**.

Often, these wounds are deeply intertwined with your relationship with your parents. They have accumulated over the course of 20 to 30 years, becoming ingrained patterns that play out repeatedly in your life.

If you take a moment to reflect, you may notice that **all the grief and anger that you were unable to process during your childhood, teenage years, and young adulthood are still waiting for you.** And, in all likelihood, a significant portion of this unresolved emotional baggage revolves around these mum and dad wounds.

#### The Parental Wounds

Your parents were your first mirrors. Your first teachers. Your first models for:
- How love works
- What you're worth
- Whether the world is safe
- Whether you're allowed to exist as yourself
- What emotions are acceptable
- What it means to be a man or woman
- How to relate to authority
- How to express needs
- How to handle conflict

**Everything you learned about yourself, you learned in relationship to them.**

And because they were human, flawed, wounded themselves, carrying their own ancestral patterns**they couldn't give you what they didn't have.**

They couldn't mirror your worth if they didn't know their own.
They couldn't allow your emotions if they couldn't handle their own.
They couldn't give you unconditional love if they'd never received it themselves.

**This created wounds.**

Not because they were evil or malicious (though sometimes they were). But because wounded people wound people.

And now, **those wounds are running your life.**

The patterns you developed to cope with those early experiences have become the lens through which you see everything:
- Your intimate relationships replay the mum or dad dynamic
- Your relationship to authority reflects how you related to your parents
- Your self-worth echoes what was reflected back to you in childhood
- Your emotional expression (or repression) mirrors what was allowed in your home
- Your ability to trust, to receive, to be vulnerableall shaped by those early years

#### Beyond Just Parents: Ancestral and Genetic Factors

It's important to recognize that **these core wounds are not limited to just your personal experiences.**

Ancestral patterns and genetic factors also contribute to the formation of your core wounds. These are the neural pathways that have been most frequently traversed in your life.

Your grandmother's unprocessed grief.
Your grandfather's rage that was never allowed expression.
The survival patterns of ancestors who lived through war, famine, oppression.
The cultural conditioning passed down through generations.

**All of this lives in you.**

While other patterns may have been built on top of these core wounds, **in order to truly reach the root cause, you will likely need to traverse these neural pathways repeatedly.**

The core wounds are the superhighways. The most traveled routes. The deepest grooves.

Which means:
- They will come up again and again
- You will think you've "already dealt with this"
- You will feel like you're going in circles
- You will get frustrated that you're "still working on the same thing"

**This is normal. This is the work.**

### THE MUM WOUND

#### Common Mum Wound Patterns:

**Abandonment:**
- She was physically or emotionally unavailable
- She was there but not present
- She was consumed by her own pain, depression, or dysfunction
- You learned: "I'm not important enough to be seen"
- You learned: "My needs don't matter"
- You learned: "Love means being invisible"

**Engulfment:**
- She made you responsible for her emotions
- She used you to fill her emptiness
- She lived through you, making you her purpose
- She couldn't see you as separate from herself
- You learned: "Love means losing myself"
- You learned: "My job is to take care of others"
- You learned: "I exist to fill other people's needs"

**Conditional Love:**
- You had to perform, achieve, be good, be perfect
- Her love was based on what you did, not who you were
- She withdrew when you didn't meet expectations
- You learned: "I have to earn love"
- You learned: "Who I am isn't enough"
- You learned: "Love is conditional on my performance"

**Critical/Judgmental:**
- Nothing you did was good enough
- She pointed out flaws, mistakes, shortcomings
- She compared you to others
- She shamed you for being "too much" or "not enough"
- You learned: "I'm fundamentally flawed"
- You learned: "I need to be perfect to be acceptable"
- You learned: "Being seen means being criticized"

**How the Mum Wound Shows Up Now:**

In your intimate relationships:
- Fear of abandonment or engulfment in partnership
- Difficulty receiving love
- Either losing yourself in relationships or being unable to fully commit
- Attracting partners who are emotionally unavailable (like she was) or enmeshed (like she was)

In your relationship with yourself:
- Harsh inner critic (her voice internalized)
- Difficulty nurturing yourself
- Not feeling worthy of care
- Either neglecting your needs or becoming consumed by self-care as compensation

In your relationship with the feminine:
- How you relate to women (if you're a man)
- How you inhabit your own femininity (if you're a woman)
- Your relationship to receptivity, emotions, intuition, nurturing

---

### THE DAD WOUND

#### Common Dad Wound Patterns:

**Absence:**
- He was physically gone (divorce, death, work)
- He was present but absent (emotionally unavailable, distant)
- You never felt like you mattered to him
- You learned: "I'm not important"
- You learned: "Men leave"
- You learned: "I'm on my own"

**Criticism/Impossibility to Please:**
- Nothing you did was good enough
- He was harsh, critical, demanding
- His standards were impossible
- He withheld approval
- You learned: "I'm a disappointment"
- You learned: "I have to constantly prove myself"
- You learned: "Love means striving and never arriving"

**Violence/Rage:**
- He was angry, explosive, unpredictable
- You walked on eggshells
- You felt unsafe in his presence
- He used his physical or emotional power to control through fear
- You learned: "Power means dominance"
- You learned: "Anger is dangerous"
- You learned: "I'm not safe"

**Weakness/Passivity:**
- He was passive, checked out, unable to protect
- He let others (maybe your mum) dominate him
- He couldn't stand up for himself or you
- You learned: "Men are weak"
- You learned: "I can't rely on anyone"
- You learned: "I have to protect myself"

**How the Dad Wound Shows Up Now:**

In your relationship to authority and power:
- How you relate to bosses, leaders, teachers
- Your own relationship to authority (do you rebel? submit? avoid?)
- Your comfort with your own power

In your intimate relationships:
- If you're a woman: the type of men you attract (absent like him? rageful like him? weak like him?)
- If you're a man: how you show up as a man (do you replicate his patterns? overcompensate?)

In your relationship with yourself:
- Your inner masculine energy (how you take action, set boundaries, protect yourself)
- Your ability to feel safe in the world
- Your relationship to achievement, success, and approval

In your relationship with the masculine:
- How you relate to men (if you're a woman)
- How you inhabit your own masculinity (if you're a man)
- Your relationship to action, protection, boundaries, direction

---

### WHY THIS MATTERS: The Patterns Playing Out

**Your relationship patterns are replications of the mum/dad dynamic.**

If your mum was critical, you'll either:
- Attract critical partners (to finally get it right, to finally be enough)
- Become hyper-vigilant about criticism, seeing it everywhere
- Develop a harsh inner critic that does her job for her

If your dad was absent, you'll either:
- Attract emotionally unavailable partners (familiar = safe to your nervous system)
- Become the one who abandons (identifying with him)
- Live in constant fear of abandonment

**The patterns repeat until you heal them.**

You're not choosing these dynamics consciously. Your nervous system is seeking the familiar. Your subconscious is trying to resolve the original wound by recreating it and "getting it right this time."

Except you can't get it right with a different person.

**You have to go back to the original wound and heal the child who formed it.**

---

## ANCHORS AND BIG WHY

This is the section that will save you when you want to quit.

Because you will want to quit. Your mind will give you a thousand reasons to stop.

Let's prepare for that.

---

### THE MIND'S RESISTANCE

As you embark on this journey of healing and personal growth, **it's crucial to be mindful of the thoughts that your mind will try to convince you of.**

Your mind, in its efforts to protect the ego and maintain the status quo, will attempt to undermine your progress at every turn. It will whisper things like:

- **"This process isn't working."**
- **"I can't believe I'm still working on this."**
- **"I thought I had already resolved this."**
- **"This is going to take forever."**
- **"It's never going to end."**
- **"I don't want to continue anymore."**

These thoughts, although tempting to succumb to, are merely the mind's way of trying to keep you within the confines of your comfort zone.

**But true growth lies beyond the boundaries of comfort.**

When these thoughts arise (and they will), you need something to anchor you back to truth.

---

### WHAT ARE ANCHORS?

To navigate these challenges more smoothly and with greater resilience, **it's essential to develop your own set of Anchors.**

**Anchors are points of truth that you have validated time and time again.**

They serve as beacons of light, illuminating your path and reminding you of your direction and goals. When you encounter those familiar stumbling blocks along the way, your Anchors will help you refocus and remember what you are aiming for.

#### Examples of Anchors:

- **After going through a process of releasing, you have experienced a profound sense of well-being that lasted for days.**
  - *This is proof it works. This is what you return to when your mind says "nothing's changing."*

- **Throughout your journey of releasing, you have come across numerous signs and synchronicities that validate the growth and transformation you are undergoing.**
  - *The universe is responding. You are on the right path.*

- **Your intuition has expanded and become a reliable guide, propelling you forward with confidence.**
  - *You're not who you were 3 months ago. The changes are real.*

- **You have come to understand that after a series of challenges and setbacks, a major breakthrough often follows, leading to significant personal growth.**
  - *The pattern: struggle í breakthrough. You've seen it before. Trust the cycle.*

#### Other Potential Anchors:

- A relationship that transformed after you did healing work
- Physical symptoms that disappeared after emotional release
- A pattern you broke (you used to react this way, and now you don't)
- Moments of profound peace or clarity you've experienced
- Feedback from others noticing your changes
- Your own journal entries showing progress over time
- Times you handled something differently than you would have before
- Moments when you caught yourself in old patterns and chose differently

**Your Anchors are your evidence.**

When your mind tells you "this isn't working," you return to your Anchors and say: "Yes, it is. Here's the proof."

---

### ANCHORS IN THE STORM

Anchors serve as a lifeline, helping you stay centered in the eye of the storm.

When challenges arise and everything seems to be falling apart, your Anchors prevent you from being swept away by thoughts such as:

- **"This means I'm completely wrong."**
- **"This is proof that God doesn't exist."**
- **"Everything I thought was right is a lie."**

Undoubtedly, **there will be times when the proverbial "shit hits the fan."** It may happen repeatedly.

The key is to develop the resilience and skills necessary to face these moments head-on, to become better at cleaning up the mess each time, and to minimize the downtime that follows.

By cultivating awareness and attunement to the warning signs, you can anticipate potential challenges and prevent them from catching you off guard.

**Anchors keep you grounded when reality seems to be crumbling.**

They remind you:
- This is temporary
- I've been here before
- I know what's real
- This too shall pass
- My healing is valid

---

### YOUR BIG WHY

In addition to Anchors, **it may be necessary for you to discover a bigger WHYa deeper purposethat will sustain you on this journey.**

If you are solely focused on clearing the obstacles in your path without considering the broader context of personal growth, you may find yourself repeatedly entangled in the same patterns, causing unnecessary suffering.

**You need a reason bigger than your pain.**

When the healing gets hard (and it will), when you're in the middle of a clearing and everything hurts (and it will), when your mind is screaming at you to stop (and it will)

**Your WHY is what keeps you going.**

#### Examples of a Bigger WHY:

- **Breaking free from the ancestral patterns that have been passed down through generations and potentially even eons.**
  - *"I'm not just healing myself. I'm healing my lineage. I'm stopping patterns that have been running for generations. This ends with me."*

- **Making a conscious decision to not repeat the same patterns and traumas that you witnessed in your parents' lives, ensuring a different future for your own children.**
  - *"My children (current or future) will not inherit these wounds. They will know a different kind of parent. This breaks with me."*

- **Choosing to undergo this process in order to contribute to the betterment of the world and share the light that you carry within.**
  - *"The world needs healed people. My healing serves something bigger. I'm doing this for the collective."*

- **Recognizing that the more you engage in this process of healing and growth, the lighter you feel. It becomes increasingly important to delve into everything you can in order to reach your highest potential sooner and maintain it for longer.**
  - *"I know what it feels like to be light. I want more of that. I want to live from that state. That's worth any amount of temporary discomfort."*

- **Embracing the understanding that the path to enlightenment encompasses all aspects of your life and offers greater rewards than solely pursuing material wealth, fulfilling relationships, business success, or a thriving career.**
  - *"This is about becoming who I actually came here to be. Everything else is secondary. This is the real work."*

#### Other Potential WHYs:

- **For your younger self:** "The child in me deserves to be free. I'm doing this for them."
- **For others who are suffering:** "If I can heal, I can show others it's possible. My healing creates permission for others."
- **For evolution itself:** "Consciousness is trying to evolve through me. I'm part of something bigger."
- **For the pure truth of it:** "I want to know reality as it actually is, not through the filter of my wounds."
- **For freedom:** "I'm tired of these patterns running me. I want to be free."

---

### YOUR WHY MUST EVOLVE

As you progress on this journey, **you will find that your BIG WHY needs to evolve and expand.**

As more light enters your life, the shadows may appear more pronounced.

To overcome this, **you will need a greater motivation, a deeper reason to continue moving forward.**

Your initial WHY might be: "I want to feel better."

But that won't be enough when you're 6 months deep and facing your darkest material.

Your WHY must deepen to something like:
- "I'm here to become the fullest expression of consciousness through this human form."
- "I'm healing for the sake of all beings."
- "This is my sacred purpose."

**And let me assure you, it will be worth it.**

---

### THE UNIVERSE WILL BRING SURPRISES

The universe has a profound understanding of who you truly areperhaps even more than you know yourself.

As you surrender to the process and find a method that resonates with you, **guided by your Anchors and your WHY**, the universe will unveil surprises that exceed your wildest dreams.

**It will find the most exquisite ways to bring you the sweetest joy and fulfillment, aligning with your deepest desires.**

This is not magical thinking. This is how reality works when you align with your healing:

- Synchronicities increase
- Doors open that were previously closed
- People show up exactly when you need them
- Opportunities appear that match your new vibration
- Resources become available
- Your manifestations speed up

**Because you're clearing the blocks.**

You're removing the static between you and the frequency of what you actually want.

You're becoming the version of yourself who can receive what's meant for you.

And the universe responds.

## PRACTICAL TOOLS

### TOOL 1: Core Wound Mapping

**Purpose:** Identify your specific mum and dad wounds and how they're playing out now.

**Instructions:**

#### Part A: The Mum Wound

In your journal, reflect on and write:

**My experience of my mother was:**
(Describe the emotional quality of your relationship with her. Not the stories, but the felt sense. Was she warm? Cold? Overwhelming? Absent? Critical? Doting?)

**The primary mum wound I carry is:**
(Abandonment? Engulfment? Conditional love? Criticism? A combination?)

**Specific examples from childhood:**
1. A time I felt abandoned/engulfed/criticized by her:
2. A message I received about my worth:
3. An emotion that wasn't allowed:

**How this wound shows up in my life now:**
- In my intimate relationships:
- In my relationship with women:
- In my relationship with myself:
- In my ability to receive:
- In my emotional expression:

**The belief this wound created:**
"I am _______________" (not enough, too much, unlovable, a burden, etc.)
"Love means _______________" (sacrifice, performance, abandonment, etc.)

#### Part B: The Dad Wound

**My experience of my father was:**
(Describe the emotional quality. Was he present? Absent? Loving? Harsh? Weak? Powerful?)

**The primary dad wound I carry is:**
(Absence? Criticism? Violence/rage? Weakness? A combination?)

**Specific examples from childhood:**
1. A time I felt unseen/criticized/unsafe with him:
2. A message I received about my worth or capability:
3. What I learned about power, protection, or safety:

**How this wound shows up in my life now:**
- In my intimate relationships:
- In my relationship with men:
- In my relationship with authority:
- In my relationship with my own power:
- In my sense of safety in the world:

**The belief this wound created:**
"I am _______________"
"Power means _______________"
"Men are _______________"

#### Part C: The Pattern Recognition

**The pattern I keep repeating is:**
(Do you keep attracting the same type of partner? Do you keep recreating the same dynamic with bosses? Do you keep abandoning yourself?)

**This pattern is a replication of:**
(Which parent wound? How is it the same?)

**What I'm trying to resolve through this pattern:**
(What are you trying to finally get? Approval? Love? Safety? To finally be enough?)

**The truth I need to accept:**
"I can't heal the original wound by recreating it with different people. I have to go back to the source."

---

### TOOL 2: Anchor Creation

**Purpose:** Create your personal set of Anchorsvalidated truths to return to when your mind tries to sabotage your healing.

**Instructions:**

**Step 1: Evidence Gathering**

Look back over your life and identify moments of validation. These can be recent (since starting this work) or from any point in your journey.

**Healing Validations:**
(Times you did healing work and experienced tangible shifts)
1.
2.
3.

**Synchronicities:**
(Times the universe sent you signs, confirmations, or "coincidences" too perfect to ignore)
1.
2.
3.

**Expanded Capacities:**
(Ways you've grownstronger intuition, more presence, clearer boundaries, etc.)
1.
2.
3.

**Pattern Breakthroughs:**
(Times you broke an old pattern or responded differently than you would have before)
1.
2.
3.

**Step 2: Anchor Statements**

For each validation above, create an Anchor Statementa sentence that captures the truth you validated.

**Example:**
- Evidence: "After my deep crying session last month, I felt light and clear for 3 days."
- Anchor Statement: "Deep emotional release brings lightness. I've experienced this. It's real."

**My Anchor Statements:**

1. _________________________________________________

2. _________________________________________________

3. _________________________________________________

4. _________________________________________________

5. _________________________________________________

6. _________________________________________________

7. _________________________________________________

8. _________________________________________________

**Step 3: Anchor Practice**

When your mind tells you:
- "This isn't working"
- "Nothing's changing"
- "This is pointless"

**Return to your Anchors and read them out loud.**

Remind yourself of what you've validated as true.

---

### TOOL 3: Defining Your Big WHY

**Purpose:** Discover the deeper purpose that will sustain you through the difficult parts of healing.

**Instructions:**

**Round 1: Surface WHYs**

Start with the obvious reasons you're doing this work:

Why did you start this healing journey?
-
-
-

What do you hope will change?
-
-
-

**Round 2: Deeper WHYs**

For each surface reason, ask: "And why does that matter?"

Example:
- Surface: "I want better relationships"
- Deeper: "Why does that matter?" í "Because I'm tired of being alone"
- Even deeper: "And why does that matter?" í "Because I want to experience real intimacy before I die"
- Core WHY: "Because I came here to know love fully, and I won't leave without experiencing it"

**Go through this process for each of your surface WHYs:**

1. Surface WHY:
   - Why does that matter?
   - And why does that matter?
   - **Core WHY:**

2. Surface WHY:
   - Why does that matter?
   - And why does that matter?
   - **Core WHY:**

**Round 3: Bigger Than You**

Now expand beyond yourself:

**Who will benefit from my healing besides me?**
- My children (current or future):
- My lineage (ancestors and descendants):
- People I'll serve or teach:
- The collective field:

**What becomes possible when I'm healed that isn't possible now?**
-
-
-

**What is my healing in service of?**
(Something bigger than your personal comfort. Something that matters at the soul level.)

---

**My BIG WHY:**

Write a statement that captures your deepest purpose for this work. This should move you. It should be big enough to carry you through the hard moments.

"I am doing this healing work because __________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________________

This is bigger than my temporary discomfort. This is why I'm here."

---

**Step 4: WHY Practice**

When you're in a healing crisis and want to quit, return to this statement.

Read it out loud.
Feel it in your body.
Reconnect to the bigger purpose.

This is your North Star.

---

### TOOL 4: Healing Crisis Preparation

**Purpose:** Prepare for the inevitable moments when "shit hits the fan."

**Instructions:**

**Recognize the Pattern:**

After a good day, expect a challenging one.
Before a breakthrough, expect a crisis.
After deep healing work, expect a wave of old material to surface.

**This is not regression. This is integration.**

**Create Your Crisis Protocol:**

When things fall apart (and they will), what will you do?

**My Crisis Anchor Plan:**

When I'm in crisis, I will:
1. Return to my Anchors (read them)
2. Remember my WHY (read it)
3. Reach out to: ___________________ (support person)
4. Use grounding practice: ___________________ (from Module 1)
5. Remind myself: "This is temporary. Healing comes in waves. I've been here before and survived."

**My Crisis Comfort:**

What helps me feel safe when everything feels chaotic?
-
-
-

**My Crisis Commitment:**

"When I'm in the middle of a healing crisis, I commit to _______________________

________________________________________________________________________

I will NOT abandon myself. I will NOT quit. I will remember this is part of the process."

---

### TOOL 5: Parent Relationship Reflection

**Purpose:** Begin processing your actual relationship with your parents (not to send, just to process).

**Instructions:**

This exercise is borrowed from the assignment section, but it's powerful enough to be a tool you return to repeatedly.

**Letter to Mother:**

Write a letter to your mother that you will NOT send (unless you genuinely choose to later). This is for YOU, not for her.

In this letter, include:
- What you needed from her that you didn't get
- How her wounds affected you
- What you're angry about (if anything)
- What you're grateful for (if anything)
- What you're forgiving (if anything)
- What you're releasing

**Don't censor. Don't be "nice." Be ruthlessly honest.**

This is YOUR processing.

**Letter to Father:**

Same process. Write to your father.

- What you needed from him that you didn't get
- How his wounds affected you
- What you're angry about
- What you're grateful for
- What you're forgiving
- What you're releasing

**After writing:**

Notice what you feel.
Notice what emotions moved.
Notice if there's more to say.

You can return to these letters as many times as you need. Add to them. Rage in them. Cry through them.

**This is your space to be fully honest about what it was like to be their child.**

## ENERGY HEALING SUPPORT

### Root Chakra Healing (For Safety and Grounding)

**Location:** Base of spine
**Color:** Red
**Associated with:** Safety, survival, belonging, family of origin, ancestral patterns

**Why this matters for core wounds:**

Your core wounds often live in your root chakra. Your earliest experiences of safety (or lack thereof) with your parents created your foundationyour root.

If that foundation was unstable, your entire energetic system reflects that instability.

**Root Chakra Healing Practice:**

1. **Grounding Visualization:**
   - Sit comfortably with feet on the ground
   - Visualize roots growing from the base of your spine down into the earth
   - See these roots going deep, anchoring you
   - Feel the earth's support beneath you
   - Breathe into the base of your spine
   - Affirm: "I am safe. I am supported. I belong here."

2. **Root Chakra Breath:**
   - Place your hand on the base of your spine
   - Breathe slowly and deeply
   - With each inhale, imagine red light filling your root chakra
   - With each exhale, release fear, instability, unworthiness
   - Continue for 5-10 minutes

3. **Earthing Practice:**
   - Go outside barefoot
   - Stand on the earth (grass, dirt, sand)
   - Feel the physical connection between your body and the ground
   - Let the earth absorb your fear and give you stability

**Signs of root chakra healing:**
- Feeling more grounded and stable
- Less anxiety about survival (money, safety, belonging)
- More trust in life's support
- Physical vitality returns
- Feeling "at home" in your body

---

### Heart Chakra Healing (For Receiving Love)

**Location:** Center of chest
**Color:** Green
**Associated with:** Love, receiving, self-worth, relationships, forgiveness

**Why this matters for core wounds:**

The mum and dad wounds closed your heart. You learned love was conditional, unsafe, or unavailable.

Your heart chakra holds the grief, the longing, and the walls you built to protect yourself.

**Heart Chakra Healing Practice:**

1. **Heart Opening Meditation:**
   - Place both hands on your heart
   - Breathe deeply into your chest
   - Feel the rise and fall of your chest under your hands
   - Visualize a green light growing in your heart center
   - With each breath, the light expands
   - Affirm: "I am worthy of love. I am safe to receive. My heart is healing."

2. **Forgiveness Breath (for parents):**
   - Think of your mother or father
   - Notice where you feel the wound in your body (usually chest, throat, or gut)
   - Breathe into that space
   - On the exhale, imagine releasing resentment, hurt, anger
   - You're not condoning what happened
   - You're releasing the charge so it stops affecting YOU
   - Repeat: "I release you from my energy field. I take my power back."

3. **Self-Love Practice:**
   - Place your hand on your heart
   - Speak to the child who didn't receive the love they needed
   - Say: "I love you. I see you. You are enough. You always were."
   - Let yourself cry if tears come
   - This is reparenting at the energetic level

**Signs of heart chakra healing:**
- Ability to receive love without suspicion
- Softening toward yourself and others
- Less defensive in relationships
- Grief moving (tears coming more easily)
- Feeling your own worthiness

---

### Combined Root + Heart Practice (For Integrating Safety and Love)

**The Healing Circuit:**

1. Start with root chakra grounding (3 minutes)
   - Roots into earth, red light at base of spine
   - "I am safe. I am supported."

2. Move to heart chakra opening (3 minutes)
   - Hands on heart, green light in chest
   - "I am worthy of love. I receive."

3. Create the circuit (3 minutes)
   - Visualize energy moving from root up to heart, and from heart down to root
   - See a column of light connecting these two centers
   - This integrates safety with love
   - You can be grounded AND open
   - You can be safe AND loving

**This practice rewires the nervous system's association between love and danger.**

For many of us, love meant danger (because our parents were the source of both love and pain).

### Chakra Affirmations for Core Wound Healing

**Root Chakra (Safety):**
- I am safe in my body
- The earth supports me
- I belong here
- I am worthy of taking up space
- My needs matter

**Heart Chakra (Love & Worthiness):**
- I am worthy of love exactly as I am
- I forgive my parents for their wounds
- I release what wasn't mine to carry
- Love is safe
- I am enough

**Practice:** Choose one affirmation and repeat it 100 times while in the chakra meditation. Let it sink into your nervous system.

## SELF-INQUIRY QUESTIONS

Sit with these questions in your journal. Don't rush. Let the answers come from deep within.

1. **Reflect on your core wounds. Can you identify patterns related to these wounds in your life? How have they influenced your relationships and self-perception?**

2. **How does the idea of ancestral patterns contributing to your core wounds resonate with you? What patterns might you be carrying that aren't originally yours?**

3. **Can you identify any resistance from your mind when you work on healing these wounds? What form does this resistance take?** (Listen for the voices: "This isn't working," "This is taking too long," etc.)

4. **Do you have Anchors in your life that keep you grounded during your healing journey? If so, what are they? If not, what could they be?**

5. **Reflect on your Big WHY. What deep purpose motivates you to keep pursuing your path of healing and personal growth?**

6. **When you think about your mother, what emotion arises first? What does that tell you about the core wound?**

7. **When you think about your father, what emotion arises first? What does that tell you about the core wound?**

8. **What pattern keeps repeating in your intimate relationships? Whose pattern is it? (Yours, your mother's, your father's?)**

9. **What did you have to sacrifice to receive love as a child?** (Your anger? Your needs? Your authentic self? Your boundaries?)

10. **If you could go back and give your childhood self one thing your parents couldn't give you, what would it be?** (This reveals the core wound)

11. **What are you hoping to finally receive from your healing that you never got from your parents?** (Permission? Validation? Safety? Unconditional love?)

12. **How will you know when your Big WHY needs to evolve? What signs will indicate you need a deeper purpose?**

## ASSIGNMENTS & HOMEWORK

Complete these over the course of Week 2. Don't rush. Deep work takes time.

### ASSIGNMENT 1: Core Wound Observation Journal (Daily for 7 Days)

**Instructions:**

Each day this week, consciously observe and note your thoughts, feelings, and reactions related to your core wounds.

**Daily prompts:**
- What situation triggered me today?
- How did I react? (What did I feel, think, do?)
- Does this reaction feel familiar from childhood?
- Which parent wound was activated? (Mum or Dad?)
- How old did I feel emotionally in that moment?

At the end of the week, review your entries and write a summary:
- What patterns emerged?
- Which core wound is most active right now?
- What's asking to be healed?

---

### ASSIGNMENT 2: Letters to Parents (Not to Send)

**Instructions:**

Write a letter to each of your parents. These are NOT to be sent (unless you genuinely choose to later, after processing).

**Letter to Mother:**

Express:
- Your feelings (all of themanger, grief, love, resentment, gratitude)
- What you needed that you didn't get
- How her wounds affected you
- What you're forgiving (if anything)
- What you're releasing

**Letter to Father:**

Express:
- Your feelings (all of them)
- What you needed that you didn't get
- How his wounds affected you
- What you're forgiving (if anything)
- What you're releasing

**Don't hold back. Don't be polite. This is YOUR processing.**

After writing, notice what shifted. Notice what emotions moved. You may need to write multiple letters over time. That's normal.

---

### ASSIGNMENT 3: Anchor Creation

**Instructions:**

Using Tool 2 (Anchor Creation), create your personal list of Anchorsvalidated truths you can return to when your mind tries to sabotage your healing.

**Deliverable:**

A written list of 5-8 Anchor Statements that capture truths you've validated through your own experience.

Keep this list somewhere accessible. You'll need it in Module 9 (Emergency Toolkit).

---

### ASSIGNMENT 4: Big WHY Discovery

**Instructions:**

Using Tool 3 (Defining Your Big WHY), go through the process of discovering your deeper purpose for this healing work.

**Deliverable:**

A written WHY statement that:
- Moves you emotionally
- Is bigger than your personal comfort
- Connects to something beyond yourself
- Will sustain you through difficult healing moments

Read this statement daily for the next week. Let it sink in.

---

### ASSIGNMENT 5: Group Sharing or Trusted Friend Processing (Optional but Powerful)

**Instructions:**

Share your insights about your core wounds, your Anchors, and your Big WHY in a safe space.

This could be:
- During a class or group session
- In a small group of fellow journeyers
- One-on-one with a trusted friend or mentor
- With a therapist or healer

**Why this matters:**

Speaking your wounds out loud in a safe, witnessed space is incredibly healing. The shame dissolves when it's met with compassion rather than judgment.

You don't have to share everything. Share what feels right.

But consider sharing something. Being witnessed is powerful.

---

### ASSIGNMENT 6: Root & Heart Chakra Practice (3x This Week)

**Instructions:**

Practice the Combined Root + Heart Healing Circuit at least 3 times this week.

**Each session:**
- 3 minutes: Root grounding
- 3 minutes: Heart opening
- 3 minutes: Creating the circuit between them

**Journal after each session:**
- What did I notice?
- What emotions came up?
- Did I feel more grounded? More open?
- What resistance arose?

---

### ASSIGNMENT 7: Crisis Preparation

**Instructions:**

Using Tool 4 (Healing Crisis Preparation), create your personal Crisis Protocol.

Write down:
- Your Anchor Plan (what you'll do when in crisis)
- Your Crisis Comfort (what helps you feel safe)
- Your Crisis Commitment (what you promise yourself)

Put this somewhere you can access it easily. You'll need it.
