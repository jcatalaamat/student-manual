COMPOSITION:

- Bottom third: Denser, darker elements (shadow)
- Middle: Transition zone
- Top third: Lighter, more open (integration/light)
- Colors: Cosmic violet (#8B7BF7) transitioning to Silver moon (#E8E6F0)

STYLE:
- Geometric, minimal

- Symmetrical or asymmetrical (both can work)
- NO text, pure visual
- Modern, mystical, professional

REQUIREMENTS:
- Square app icon (1024x1024px)
- Recognizable at 60px
- High contrast
