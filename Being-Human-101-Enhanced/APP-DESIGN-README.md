### HOW IT WORKS

#### 1. Onboarding Quiz
```
"What brings you here today?"

□ Childhood trauma / Core wounds
□ Relationship patterns repeating
□ Anxiety / Depression
□ Physical symptoms (pain, tension)
□ Self-sabotage / Inner conflict
□ Spiritual awakening / Growth
□ Just exploring / Not sure

Based on answers → AI recommends starting path(s)
```

#### 2. Path-Specific Content

**Each path has:**
- ✅ Complete curriculum (modules/lessons)
- ✅ Unique practices/exercises
- ✅ Path-specific AI dialogue partner
- ✅ Custom progress tracking
- ✅ Specialized meditation library
- ✅ Methodology-aligned journaling

#### 3. Cross-Path Integration

**Users can:**
- Start with one path, add others later
- Switch between paths for different issues
- Use "Integrative Path" for AI-guided combination
- See how different modalities address same issue

**Example Integration:**
```
Issue: "I keep sabotaging my relationships"

SHADOW PATH suggests:
→ Module 2: Core Wounds (attachment patterns)
→ Module 3: Shadow Work (projection recognition)

PARTS PATH suggests:
→ Meet the "Self-Saboteur" part
→ Dialogue: What is it protecting you from?

SOMATIC PATH suggests:
→ Where do you feel it in your body?
→ Polyvagal nervous system regulation

CBT PATH suggests:
→ Identify cognitive distortions
→ Challenge limiting beliefs

AI INTEGRATIVE:
"Let's start with SOMATIC regulation to calm your
nervous system, then use PARTS dialogue to understand
the protective part, then SHADOW work to identify the
core wound. We'll use CBT skills for daily management."
```

### 🌀 PATH 6: INTEGRATIVE PATH (AI-Guided Combination)

**Core Philosophy:** Different issues need different approaches, AI determines optimal methodology mix

**How It Works:**

1. **Issue Input:** User describes current challenge

2. **AI Analysis:**
   ```
   "Breaking down your issue:

   ROOT CAUSE: Core wound (Mum wound - abandonment)
   MECHANISM: Protective part (avoiding intimacy)
   SYMPTOM: Anxiety in relationships
   BODY: Chest tightness, rapid heart rate
   THOUGHT: 'They'll leave me anyway'

   Recommended approach:
   1. SOMATIC: Regulate nervous system (you're in fight/flight)
   2. PARTS: Dialogue with protective part
   3. SHADOW: Core wound healing (Module 2)
   4. CBT: Challenge thought ('They'll leave')
   5. QUANTUM: Timeline work (relationship you desire)
   ```

3. **Personalized Protocol:**
   - Multi-methodology session structure
   - AI guides through each modality
   - Tracks which approaches work best for you
   - Adapts based on progress

**AI-Generated Session Example:**
```
TODAY'S SESSION: Relationship Anxiety

Step 1: SOMATIC (5 min)
→ "Let's regulate your nervous system first"
→ Guided breathing + bilateral stimulation

Step 2: PARTS WORK (10 min)
→ "Let's talk to the part that's protecting you"
→ AI facilitates dialogue

Step 3: SHADOW INTEGRATION (10 min)
→ "This connects to your abandonment wound"
→ The 5 Questions excavation

Step 4: CBT SKILL (5 min)
→ "Challenge the thought: 'They'll leave'"
→ Evidence for/against

Step 5: INTEGRATION (5 min)
→ Timeline visualization: Secure relationship
→ Journal reflection
```

**Best For:**
- People overwhelmed by choices
- Complex, multi-layered issues
- Those who want AI to guide them
- Comprehensive transformation seekers

**Progress Metrics:**
- Modalities used (percentage breakdown)
- Most effective approach per issue
- Cross-path integration successes
- Holistic healing score

```

### 🧘 Somatic AI: "Soma"

<a name="questions-to-answer"></a>
## ❓ QUESTIONS TO ANSWER BEFORE STARTING

### 1. **Platform Priority?**
- [ ] iOS first (beta test with Apple users)
- [ ] iOS + Android simultaneously (broader reach)
- [ ] Include web version in v1 (Tamagui supports this)

**Recommendation:** iOS first (faster iteration), Android 2-4 weeks later

---

### 2. **AI Provider Strategy?**
- [ ] OpenAI (GPT-4o) only
- [ ] Claude (Anthropic) only
- [ ] Both (switch based on task/path)
- [ ] Add Gemini for certain tasks

**Recommendation:** Both GPT-4o + Claude
- GPT-4o: Fast, general dialogue, recommendations
- Claude: Shadow work, Parts work (emotional nuance)

---

### 3. **Monetization Final Decision?**
- [ ] $97 one-time
- [ ] $147 one-time (recommended)
- [ ] $27/month subscription
- [ ] Hybrid: Both one-time + subscription options

**Recommendation:** Hybrid ($147 one-time OR $27/mo)
- Gives users choice
- Maximizes conversions

---

### 4. **Audio Strategy?**
- [ ] Text-to-speech only (faster to launch, free)
- [ ] Pre-recorded audio (higher quality, expensive)
- [ ] Hybrid: TTS for v1, recorded for v2

**Recommendation:** Hybrid
- Launch with TTS (Expo Speech is good quality)
- Add pre-recorded premium library later
- Sell as add-on ($47)

---

### 5. **Community Features Priority?**
- [ ] Launch with community (more complex)
- [ ] Launch without, add v2 (simpler, faster)
- [ ] Skip community entirely (focus on 1-on-1 experience)

**Recommendation:** Launch without, add v2
- Community is nice-to-have, not essential
- Adds complexity (moderation, servers)
- Can add based on user demand

---

### 6. **Content Scope for v1?**
- [ ] Shadow Path only (full 16 modules + workbooks)
- [ ] Shadow + Parts (2 complete paths)
- [ ] All 5 paths (ambitious but complete vision)

**Recommendation:** Shadow Path complete + 3-5 modules each for other paths
- Demonstrates multi-path concept
- Manageable content workload
- Can expand other paths post-launch

---

### 7. **Backend Strategy?**
- [ ] Supabase (recommended - auth, sync, storage)
- [ ] Firebase (alternative)
- [ ] Custom backend (overkill for v1)
- [ ] Offline-first, no backend initially

**Recommendation:** Supabase
- Handles auth, database, storage, realtime
- PostgreSQL (powerful queries)
- Row Level Security (privacy)
- Edge Functions (hide AI API keys)
- Generous free tier

---

### 8. **Analytics & Tracking?**
- [ ] Mixpanel (recommended - user behavior)
- [ ] Amplitude (alternative)
- [ ] PostHog (open-source option)
- [ ] None initially (privacy-first)

**Recommendation:** Mixpanel
- Understand user behavior
- Optimize conversion funnel
- A/B testing capability
- Privacy-compliant

---

### 9. **Existing Tamagui Setup?**
- [ ] Have existing Tamagui boilerplate ready
- [ ] Starting from scratch
- [ ] Want recommendation for starter

**If starting from scratch, recommend:**
- `create-tamagui-app` (official starter)
- Or `t3-app` (Tamagui + tRPC + Expo)

---

### 10. **Launch Timeline Target?**
- [ ] ASAP (3-4 months, MVP)
- [ ] Polished v1 (5-6 months)
- [ ] Feature-complete (7-8 months)
- [ ] No rush, perfection (9-12 months)

**Recommendation:** Polished v1 in 5-6 months
- MVP feels incomplete
- Feature-complete delays learnings
- 5-6 months = solid product + fast feedback

---

### 11. **Brand Identity?**
- [ ] Use "Being Human 101" branding
- [ ] Create new app-specific brand
- [ ] Separate brand for marketplace positioning

**Recommendation:** "Being Human 101" brand
- Leverage existing content
- You're the founder/expert
- Can always rebrand later if needed

---

### 12. **Target Audience Priority?**
- [ ] General wellness seekers
- [ ] Trauma survivors
- [ ] Spiritual seekers
- [ ] Therapy clients (complement to therapy)
- [ ] All of the above

**Recommendation:** Start with trauma survivors + spiritual seekers
- Most aligned with Shadow work
- Willing to pay for depth
- Word of mouth effect strong
- Can expand to general wellness later

---

## 💬 FINAL THOUGHTS

This app has the potential to be **truly revolutionary** in the transformation/wellness space.

**Why it will succeed:**

✅ **Unique positioning** - No one else has multi-path modular therapy
✅ **Deep content** - Not surface-level wellness
✅ **AI that actually helps** - Path-specific intelligence
✅ **Beautiful UX** - Premium feel
✅ **Proven psychology** - Gamification that works (Duolingo-level)
✅ **Your expertise** - Being Human 101 methodology is powerful
✅ **Freemium done right** - Free tier delivers value, paid tier is obvious upgrade
✅ **Scalable** - Digital product, high margins
✅ **Timely** - Mental health crisis, AI boom, app economy mature

**Potential challenges:**

⚠️ **Content workload** - Multiple paths = lots of content
⚠️ **AI costs** - Can get expensive at scale (solution: optimize prompts, cache responses)
⚠️ **App store approval** - Mental health apps scrutinized (solution: disclaimers, not medical advice)
⚠️ **Retention** - Transformation apps have high churn (solution: gamification, community, real results)

**Mitigations built in:**
- Freemium reduces CAC
- AI provides personalized experience (retention)
- Multi-path keeps users engaged longer
- Gamification drives daily use
- Community creates network effects
