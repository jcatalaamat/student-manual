   - Personalization engine (learns user patterns)
   - Beautiful Co-Star-style UI
   - Calendar system (moon, custom cycles)
   - Journaling/tracking

   - Data inputs (what to track - cycles, energy, plants, etc.)
   - Pricing (they set it)

3. **You Charge:**
   - **Option A:** $997/month platform fee (they keep all revenue)
   - **Option B:** 10% of all subscription revenue (you make money as they grow)
   - **Option C:** Hybrid: $297/mo + 5% of revenue

- Same platform, different content/branding
- She charges $12/mo
- She gets 500 subscribers = $6K/mo

**User 1:** Just wants menstrual tracking â†’ $5/mo
**User 2:** Wants life + business + body â†’ $17/mo
**User 3:** Wants everything â†’ $27/mo

**Average:** $12/mo

**10,000 users Ã— $12/mo = $120K/month = $1.44M/year**

**Why This Works:**
- Start with one module (easy to build)
- Add modules over time (compound value)
- Users customize their experience
- Higher LTV (users add modules over time)

## ðŸ’¡ MY RECOMMENDATION

**Build: Co-Star for Entrepreneurs (Launch Almanac) FIRST**

**Why:**
1. You're the target user (you GET it)
2. Spiritual entrepreneurs are underserved
3. You can beta test on yourself
4. Passionate, paying niche
5. Can expand to "Everything App" later

**Then:**
1. White-label it for 3-5 influencer friends
2. Charge 10% revenue share
3. Generate $5K-15K/mo passive income from rev share
4. Use that to fund building more modules

**End Game:**
- Launch Almanac (your brand) = $50K/mo
- 5 white-label partners = $10K/mo rev share
- Total: $60K/mo = $720K/year

**This is the path.** ðŸš€
