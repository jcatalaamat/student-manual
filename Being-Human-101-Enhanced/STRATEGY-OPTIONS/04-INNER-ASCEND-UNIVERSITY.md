‚úÖ You love the **Mindvalley model** and want to replicate it

---

## üöÄ VALIDATION BEFORE BUILDING

**Before investing $200-300K and 12 months, validate:**

1. **Survey Your Practitioners:**
   - "Would you create a 10-module course for Inner Ascend University?"
   - "Would you lead monthly live sessions?"
   - "Would you accept 30% rev share on memberships attributed to you?"
   - Need 5+ enthusiastic yeses

2. **Pre-Sell Annual Memberships:**
   - Create landing page explaining the vision
   - "Join Inner Ascend University - launching Q3 2025"
   - "Early bird: $297/year (regular $399)"
   - Goal: Pre-sell to 100-200 people ($30-60K in pre-revenue)
   - If you can't pre-sell 100, don't build this

3. **Run a Live Pilot (No App):**
   - 3-month pilot with 50 people
   - Use existing tools: Kajabi (courses), Zoom (lives), Circle (community)
   - Charge $297 for 3 months
   - See if people love it, stick around, want more
   - If successful ‚Üí Build custom app
   - If not ‚Üí Pivot to simpler option

---

## üîÄ PIVOT OPTIONS FROM THIS:

**If this doesn't work:**
- **Downsize to Single-Path App:** Keep your Being Human 101 course, drop practitioners, simplify
- **Multi-Path App:** Keep 3-5 courses, remove live/community, make it self-paced

**If this works too well:**
- **Add In-Person Retreats:** Annual gathering, $3-5K/person
- **Build Physical Locations:** Inner Ascend centers in major cities (multi-million $ vision)
- **Franchise Model:** License to regional facilitators
- **Venture Capital:** Raise $5-10M to scale to 100K+ members in 3 years

---

## üìù FINAL THOUGHTS

This is the **biggest, boldest vision**. It's not an app - it's a **company**. It's not a side project - it's a **movement**.

**If you can pull this off:**
- $10M/year by Year 5
- 20,000+ members transformed
- 20+ practitioners employed
- A platform that outlives you

**If you can't:**
- It's expensive ($200-300K Year 1)
- It's slow (12 months to launch)
- It's risky (depends on practitioners showing up)

**Key Question:**
Do you have the practitioners ready? If yes, this could be Mindvalley 2.0. If no, start simpler.
