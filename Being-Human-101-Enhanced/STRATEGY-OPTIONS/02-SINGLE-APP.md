### **2. AI Shadow Work Partner**

**Your 24/7 Companion:**
- Personalized to Being Human 101 methodology
- Trained on your content, your language, your approach
- Available for dialogue anytime users need support

**What it does:**

**Example Interaction:**
```
User: "I'm feeling really triggered by my partner right now."

AI: "Let's explore this together. Remember Module 3 - when we judge someone strongly, we're often disowning something in ourselves. What about your partner's behavior is triggering you most right now?"

User: "They're being so controlling."

AI: "Okay. Take a breath. Now ask yourself: 'What am I disowning in myself?' Is there a part of you that wants to be more in control but you've pushed that away? Or perhaps a part that feels out of control and needs structure?"

[Guides user through projection recognition from Module 3]
```
