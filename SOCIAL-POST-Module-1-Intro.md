## POST 1: The Inside Reflects the Outside (Foundation)

**The inside is the reflection of the outside.**

**That which we carry inside will be reflected outside back at us.**

With this one statement alone, most of the work can be done, understood, and transcended.

Whenever in doubt, in confusion, or in despair, come back to this one truth.

This is the most important piece of the puzzle.

You can't afford letting one minute more not knowing why you do what you do. You can't afford letting one minute more not knowing what is your intention for everything you do or don't do.

Knowing the reason you do anything and everything, will set you free.

Not knowing really is looking away from oneself, bypassing, not taking responsibility for yourself, lying to oneself, distancing from the truth of who you are.

Inside of you there are many aspects. Imagine these as mini copies of you, they have their own thoughts, feelings and emotions, and there are hundreds, if not thousands. They all have something to say.

These aspects are fragments of you, of your psyche, frozen in time, in your emotional body, and they are still reliving the situation that split them from you in the first place.

Their consciousness has not evolved, as they are not an integrated part of the one running yourself. They are like small versions of you, little you's, and they live inside your psyche town, and they all get a vote into what your reaction to life is in any given action.

**You have two choices in healing:**

The unconscious way: Allow life to create situations that explode in your face until you learn.

The conscious way: Actively explore your psyche, seeking out places that need healing.

**You can't avoid your healing, only delay it.**

And eventually you will learn the lessons you came here to learn.

The question is, are you going to do the minimum to pass the game or are you going to do the best you can, since anyway this is your only ride?

Are you going to be a human that adds to this planet, or that subtracts from it?

## POST 2: Radical Honesty (Permission to Look)

**Radical Honesty.**

The journey will require yourself to become radically honest with yourself and your relationships with others.

If you keep lying to yourself about a situation, you will forever stay locked and repeat the same patterns over and over again.

**In order to see the light, you must shade the darkness.**

**In order to shade the darkness, you must accept it.**

There will be lots of stuff coming out of you as you step into this path of self-discovery and as you begin to get in touch with other aspects of you, the darkness of each one of them is going to come out, into your awareness.

You must hold yourself in all these moments, accepting what is, and who these parts are. What they went through, and the mechanisms they used to survive in life.

Radical Honesty means that when you get to meet each part of yourself, you don't look away from what you find. That you don't lie to yourself trying to hide some aspect of you.

These aspects are not you, they are reflections of what you were made feel, think, and believe, and they may not be very pretty at times.

Virtues to cultivate are going to be self-awareness, non-judgement, courage, determination, strength, thoroughness, benevolence, understanding, integrity and nurturing.

You have to be willing to go within. You have to be able to sit with yourself and spend time with yourself in order to unlock all the pieces laying within you.

You have to get to know yourself, from the inside out.

You have to know your inner child, and every other constellation that lives within.

It is a journey of self-discovery, the path to enlightenment.

To be able to love yourself first you need to know yourself. Then you will be able to love everyone else.

**Without you, there is no one else. Without you, there is nothing else.**

## POST 3: All Is Trauma (The Spectrum)

**All is trauma.**

You've got to tattoo that one.

There is big trauma and small trauma.

It's a spectrum.

You can choose softer words to describe it and yet it all is the same thing in a different scale and weight.

Anywhere where there was a split in you, an aspect was created, that was trauma.

Anywhere where you didn't understand what was going on and didn't manage to make peace with it, that remained as trauma.

It is a split personality, an aspect, because a part of you that didn't manage to make sense of it did not manage to move on from that. In some space or dimension, that part of you remained intact, frozen, waiting to be figured out.

And to be figured out, it required to manifest the same issue in life for to be able to be faced again, understood, and move on from it.

**Your story is full of these.**

Most of these wounds were created when you were young, very young, and some other during teenage years. From there, mostly you increased the severity of the neural pathway that reinforced that pattern, that trauma.

Whenever something overloaded you, trauma was created. A tightening in your body, and potentially a disassociation and in some cases PTSD.

We all have PTSD in some form, in some hidden place in our psyche.

We often times need the right person to trigger us right there, someone who can mirror the original wound and replicate similar environment to enable such wound to come to surface with the intention of being healed.

**We are the ones creating the situations around us in order to have a chance to overcome them and integrate the wound that was caused on us.**

It is our natural ability as human beings. We heal, and in order to heal we bring up what needs to come out in order to be transformed.

It is our power. Our gift.

Some may see it as a curse. Some may resist the idea that we create trouble for ourselves in order to heal.

Well, there are two ways.

The unconscious or the conscious way.

You either let your higher-self guide you towards a situation that will explode on your face in order for you to learn from it, or you guide yourself consciously through your psyche looking for all these places that need attention for you to heal.

**Most of our lives we've done this unconsciously. We have let life teach us the 'hard' way.**

This is how we've awakened.

## POST 4: The Black Sheep (Who This Is For)

There was a time where we were not conscious and eventually after enough trauma and heart break we began being aware.

It didn't choose everyone. Not everyone went through this awakening, almost as if in order to be 'awakened' required a special threshold of trauma, not too little and not too much, in order to remain socially functional and yet out of the norm.

**The black sheep.**

The fact is that we're aware of what is happening inside of us whilst most of us live asleep a life that seems empty from the outside.

I know it is not empty, yet some lack the determination to look within for answers, and cover their plate with whatever distraction they can in order to remain asleep.

Many of you may have been there.

Alcohol, sex, drugs, food, work, studies, charity, tv, sports, shopping, and basically anything that can be turned into an obsession, will become a coping mechanism for the emptiness we feel inside.

Like ancient cultures say, anything when in excess can be poison. Same goes the other way around, anything when in moderation can be medicine.

All of these ones can allow for us to disassociate from reality, distancing ourselves from the truth we carry inside. They can be a distraction to our evolution.

**We're not meant to just stop the 'bad' habits.**

**We're meant to understand why are there for. What are they protecting, what are they a cover for.**

When many little traumas accumulate into bigger ones, extreme coping mechanisms and imbalances happen within our system. This may be called energetic blockages, chakra imbalances, emotional wounds, wounded soul, teared auric field, heart break.

There are main wounds in your system and they are the priority to be worked on, and yet soon after the secondary and other smalls more subtle wounds will come up for the initiate who's looking for truth and self-realisation.

Like a coiling snake, they will intertwine, like in a videogame, you will work in some minor issues and then the big boss will be revealed. Then you will celebrate and soon after another minor challenge will span, to soon after become the big boss once again.

These are waves of light and healing into your life and soul, and they are coming no matter what you do in life.

There are deadlines you will not miss, you will only manage to reach them in a better or worse position, better or less well equipped.

**You can't avoid your healing, only delay it.**

And eventually you will learn the lessons you came here to learn.

**The question is, are you going to do the minimum to pass the game or are you going to do the best you can, since anyway this is your only ride?**

## POST 5: The Call (What Awaits)

It all depends how far you want to go.

You may be here to heal some clear patterns that are annoying in your life, or you may be here because you want to be the highest version of yourself.

You are the one who chooses how far you go.

You may come in and out of this process, and leave for some time and then come back to it when it feels like you need more of it.

**I feel like the better I feel, the better I live, the faster I manifest, the more I create.**

**The lighter I am the faster and further I go.**

It is going to take discipline, and you will have to be thorough, if you want to sustain positive changes in your life and the life of others you touch.

The alternative is to remain asleep, each one in their own different level, and allow the natural course of your subconscious and wounded mind to take you on a journey of repetition and crashing against the same shores again and again until an aspect of you decides to change and changes the overall vote that your psyche needs to take a new path of action.

**If you follow through, it will release an almost immeasurable amount of pain and suffering, and it will exponentially elevate your position in life, expanding yourself into a new way of being, with an ever opening heart, and will certainly allow you to become the wildest version of yourself you've ever dared to dream of.**

It will most probably be a very challenging path, and it will be worth it.

The outcome of releasing all the extra weight you've been carried for decades if not millennia will definitely be felt, and once release, the lightness will carry you effortlessly.

You've got to let go of control and turn inwards until you find your own knowing about how things work, how they turn you on and what exactly are you here for.

**Everything that you need to know is already within yourself.**

**All the answers are found within one.**

The challenge here is to overcome the disconnection with oneself that we have inherited from a very long time of collective unconsciousness. All this has contributed into the desensitisation of one's inner wisdom and intelligence.

Reconnecting with yourself will bring about awareness, and information that has been long kept in the depths of your being.

**The body knows how to heal.**

It is our job to get our mind out of the way in order for it to do what it needs in order for you to heal.
