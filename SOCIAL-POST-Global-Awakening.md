## POST 1: We Are One of the First Generations

Years ago our parents wouldn't have thought or known about the concept of shadow and realising of social conditioning. Before that we would have probably been internalised in a psychiatric hospital.

The possibilities are greater now.

We are seeming to be in a level where we can finally are ready to do the work of transcending that which has kept us in chains for millennia.

**We are one of the first few generations that can and are doing the work of liberation from that which has been in the darkness or we weren't safe enough to even think about focusing on it.**

During generations we're decreasing the level of trauma into a level that we can now observe and deal with.

Maybe your father wasn't emotional, but his father was really mean and distant, the previous died in a war, and the previous had a very strong unhealthy masculine.

We're talking about trillions of ancestors before you that were needed for you to be here now.

**And you are here, right now, in the exact moment in human history where we can finally break free.**

This is not a coincidence.

You are not here by accident.

The fact that you are aware of what is happening inside of us whilst most of us live asleep a life that seems empty from the outside - that makes you one of the chosen ones.

Not chosen by some external force.

**Chosen by the sheer accumulation of ancestral pain that reached exactly the right threshold in you to wake you up.**

Not too little trauma to stay asleep.

Not too much to be socially dysfunctional.

Just enough to make you the black sheep.

Just enough to make you question everything.

Just enough to make you DO THE WORK OTHERS ARE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH TO DO.

When enough of us do this work, when enough of us evolve, so do the people around us, carried by our love and energy as so do the people around them.

**When enough of this, all the people in the world will be touched, and we will finally be beginning to transcend our human condition in a global scale.**

This is happening right now.

You are part of it.

## POST 2: The Collective Shift Is Not Coming - It's Here

Look around you.

People are waking up.

Not in some mystical fluffy candy way.

**In the messy, heartbreaking, can't-ignore-it-anymore way.**

The old systems are crumbling because they were built on collective trauma, passed down generation after generation until your parents passed it onto you.

Social conditioning that worked for keeping people asleep for thousands of years is now being questioned:

Money is hard to make - QUESTIONED
Life is hard - QUESTIONED
Relationships aren't easy - QUESTIONED
Keep your head down, it'll be safer - QUESTIONED
Don't go out of the norm - QUESTIONED
Success will eat you - QUESTIONED
Showing emotions is weak - QUESTIONED

**The lie is collapsing.**

And as it collapses, people are experiencing healing crises on a massive scale.

You see it everywhere:

The great resignation - people refusing to live unconsciously
The mental health crisis - suppressed trauma coming to surface
The political chaos - collective shadow work being forced
The relationship breakdowns - old patterns no longer sustainable
The spiritual awakening - people remembering they have a soul

**This is not disorder. This is the natural healing process of humanity.**

When you don't accept what is in front of you, you are going against life.

The world is going through what you go through individually when you start this work.

Resistance. Denial. Anger. Grief. Bargaining.

And eventually - acceptance.

And from acceptance - transformation.

**My only intention is for my own evolution, and as I evolve, so do the people around me.**

You doing your inner work is not selfish.

It is the most generous thing you can do for the planet.

Every pattern you break, you break for your lineage - past and future.

Every wound you heal, you heal for the collective.

**You are not healing just for you. You are healing for all of us.**

## POST 3: The World's Pain Is Not Yours - You Are The Transmuter

IT IS THE WORLD'S PAIN AND DARKNESS, NOT YOURS.

YOU ARE THE TRANSMUTTER.

Let me explain what's happening right now on this planet.

We ALL carry the darkness. We ALL have inherited these patterns.

Racism. Sexism. Violence. Greed. Control. Abuse.

Maybe your pattern has a 1% of that one, and the other one has 0.5% of the other. Still is some.

**We all carry it. We are all reflections of each other.**

Looking away from your own shadow will only serve for your spiritual ego to keep growing.

There's no point for your spiritual Ego to be complaining about what happens in the other side of the world if that complaining is not bringing about any change in yourself.

**As long as you are triggered by it, you are contributing to the energy of it REMAINING in the planet.**

Only that which SLIPS off you, you will be letting go of.

What SLIPS you will not feed off you in order to exist in this universe.

If rape triggers you - there's trauma about powerlessness and sexuality you haven't cleared.

If murder triggers you - there's rage and unexpressed emotion you're carrying.

If politicians trigger you - there's authority wounds from your parents.

If rich people trigger you - there's scarcity and unworthiness programming.

**Everything you reject you desire in some part. Everything that is not in alignment either attracts you or repels you.**

This is radical honesty.

This is the only way forward.

Ram Das said if you don't accept the current state of the world, which means to be at peace with what is, you are rejecting life itself.

**If you don't accept the current state of CONSCIOUSNESS, in this world and the universe, you are rejecting LIFE ITSELF.**

I am not saying we don't have to act to make the world better.

I am saying that the ONLY way to truly change the world is to stop being triggered by it and START TRANSMUTING IT THROUGH YOUR OWN HEALING.

You are the brave courageous being who is not scared to look within and say hey I see you hurt here and I won't be looking away and make look like I don't know you are here.

**When you do this, you will begin to see more beneath people's truths, you will see where they hurt, what they lie themselves and you about, everything.**

You will become X-Ray glasses and everywhere you look you will be NEO from THE MATRIX.

You will see through the codes, the programming, into the truth of reality and EXISTENCE.

And from that place of clarity - you will change everything.

## POST 4: The Timeline Is Accelerating

These are waves of light and healing into your life and soul, and they are coming no matter what you do in life.

**There are deadlines you will not miss, you will only manage to reach them in a better or worse position, better or less well equipped.**

Can you feel it?

Time is speeding up.

What used to take years of therapy now takes months.

What used to take months now takes weeks.

The veils are thinning.

The quantum field of possibilities is more accessible than ever before.

**This is the reason why surrendering to the process is important.**

The universe knows you better than you know yourself, and what you thought was right for you years ago turns out to be something completely different now.

The universe will surprise you in ways you can't yet dream to imagine.

It will find the sweetest way to bring you the sweetest joy and fulfilment through your wildest desires.

But you have to be ready.

**You can't avoid your healing, only delay it.**

And eventually you will learn the lessons you came here to learn.

The question is - are you going to reach those deadlines dragging your feet, kicking and screaming, resisting every step?

Or are you going to show up equipped, ready, skilled at navigating the waves of transformation?

**The choice has always been yours.**

The unconscious way: Allow life to create situations that explode in your face until you learn.

The conscious way: Actively explore your psyche, seeking out places that need healing.

Most of our lives we've done this unconsciously. We have let life teach us the 'hard' way.

But right now, in this timeline, on this planet, we have a choice.

**And more people are choosing the conscious way than ever before in human history.**

This is the shift.

Not some event in the future.

Not some magical date when everything suddenly changes.

**The shift is you, choosing differently, right now.**

Millions of us, making that choice, every single day.

That's what's changing the world.

That's what's breaking the chains.

## POST 5: Everything I Do, I Do For The Children

Let me tell you my BIG WHY.

And maybe it will help you find yours.

**Everything I do, I do for the children.**

I can't avoid having gone through what I've gone through.

What I can do is make sure I do everything in my power to make sure that no more children go through the same.

This means education. Lots of education. Lots of inner work.

Make sure I am impeccable with my words, actions and thoughts.

Making sure that wherever I go I add up instead of subtract.

Forgive myself when I fail, when I pull people down, and then stand up as fast as possible, taking care of myself first, and continue moving forward learning, expanding, and sharing with others what I've learnt.

**Let my vibration be the medicine for others.**

For what I've seen and what I've grown, what I've learnt.

Transfer it to every place I walk and to everyone I touch even if it is through our quantum field in the same space and yet a different time.

That the day I am in my death bed I am at peace with myself and my addition to the world.

No regrets.

Not feeling like I let someone down, the world down.

**That my compass was always looking to grow and to expand. To be myself. And that the becoming onto myself was encompassing the wellbeing of all things in this planet and any other.**

This is what the awakening looks like.

Not transcending the physical world and floating away.

But being SO grounded in your truth, SO aligned with your highest timeline, SO clear of your ancestral patterns that you become a BEACON.

A lighthouse for others still lost in the storm.

**Don't let anyone else go through anything like you've ever gone through before.**

Make sure no child has to go through what you went, what your partner went through, what other people you know went through.

And then extend it to basic needs, that no one is in hunger, that there's no illness, that there is no separation, and where there is love everywhere.

**This is the work.**

This is why we're here.

This is why you woke up.

Not to transcend the world - but to HEAL it.

One human at a time.

Starting with yourself.

**As Buddha said: Love yourself first, and then others.**

You will only be able to guide others into that which you've already gone yourself.

The world doesn't need more teachers who haven't done the work.

**The world needs YOU, fully healed, fully embodied, fully alive.**

Ready?
