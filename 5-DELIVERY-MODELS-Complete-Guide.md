### REVENUE MODEL

**Evergreen Revenue (Ongoing):**
- 40 active members x $297/month = $11,880/month
- Or: 10 new one-time payments x $2,100 = $21,000/quarter
- Passive/semi-passive income between cohorts

**Live Cohort Revenue (3x per year):**
- 30 students x $4,200 = $126,000 per cohort
- 3 cohorts per year = $378,000

**Upgrade Revenue:**
- 15 Evergreen students upgrade per year
- 15 x $2,400 (upgrade fee) = $36,000

**Total Annual Revenue Potential:**
- Evergreen: $142,560 ($11,880 x 12)
- Live Cohorts: $378,000
- Upgrades: $36,000
- **TOTAL: $556,560/year**

*(This assumes established program; Year 1 will be lower)*

- Or: accept lower production value

### SMALL GROUP DYNAMICS

**Optimal Group Size Reasoning:**

**6 participants:**
- Pros: Very intimate, everyone gets lots of airtime
- Cons: Financial risk if people drop out, less diversity of perspective

**8 participants:**
- OPTIMAL - Intimacy + enough people for rich discussion
- Safe if 1-2 people drop out
- Everyone can share deeply in 3-hour session
- Diversity of perspectives

**10 participants:**
- Still intimate enough
- Good financial model
- Requires tight facilitation to ensure everyone shares

**12 participants:**
- Maximum before losing intimacy
- Risk of some people not sharing
- Financial sweet spot
- Need excellent facilitation skills

**More than 12:**
- No longer "small group"
- Becomes cohort model
- Intimacy lost

---

### GROUP AGREEMENTS

**Established in Week 1:**

1. **Confidentiality:** What's shared in group stays in group
2. **Non-judgment:** All experiences welcome, no shaming
3. **Equal airtime:** Everyone shares, no one dominates
4. **Authentic presence:** Show up as you are, not performed
5. **Respect process:** Honor each person's unique journey
6. **Commitment:** Show up every week unless true emergency
7. **Boundaries:** Respect each other's boundaries
8. **Support, not fix:** Hold space, don't try to fix each other
9. **Somatic consent:** Physical touch only with explicit consent
10. **Trigger responsibility:** Manage your own triggers with support

## PRICING PHILOSOPHY & RECOMMENDATIONS

---

### VALUE-BASED PRICING MINDSET

**Don't Undercharge - This Work Is Life-Changing**

Consider what you're providing:
- Decades of therapy compressed into 16 weeks
- Tools for lifetime self-healing
- Liberation from generational trauma
- Access to authentic self
- Skills to navigate all future challenges

**This is priceless. Price accordingly.**

---

### COMPARISON TO ALTERNATIVES

Help students see value by comparing:

**Weekly Therapy:**
- $150-$300 per session
- 52 weeks = $7,800-$15,600/year
- Years of therapy = $20k-$50k+
- **Your 16-week program at $4,000 is a bargain**

**Intensive Retreat:**
- 7-day retreat: $5,000-$15,000
- Plus travel, time off work
- One week of transformation
- **Your 16 weeks provides more depth and integration**

**Coaching Programs:**
- Similar length programs: $5,000-$15,000
- Often less depth and methodology
- Less transformative
- **Your program delivers more value**

**DIY/Self-Help:**
- Books, courses, workshops over years: $3,000-$10,000
- Lacks accountability and support
- Easy to bypass and intellectualize
- **Your program ensures actual transformation**

**Cost of NOT Healing:**
- Repeated relationship failures
- Career limitations
- Health problems from stress
- Passing trauma to children
- **Priceless to break these cycles**

---

### ACCESSIBILITY STRATEGIES (Without Devaluing)

**You can serve more people without underpricing:**

#### 1. SLIDING SCALE SPOTS (10-20% of cohort)

**Structure:**
- Offer 2-4 spots per cohort at reduced rate
- Range: $1,800-$2,800 (vs. $4,000 regular price)
- Application required (honor system financial need)
- Must demonstrate commitment (why them, why now)

**Benefits:**
- Maintains value of regular pricing
- Serves those with genuine financial barriers
- Creates goodwill and accessibility
- Doesn't devalue program

**How to Offer:**
- Don't advertise publicly (race to the bottom)
- Mention in discovery calls if relevant
- Application process ensures commitment
- Limited spots maintain scarcity

---

#### 2. SCHOLARSHIP FUND (Pay It Forward)

**Structure:**
- Past participants can "pay it forward"
- Donate to scholarship fund
- You match donations
- Scholarships awarded to applicants

**Benefits:**
- Creates community of giving
- Alumni stay connected
- Demonstrates program value (people pay it forward)
- Sustainable model

---

#### 3. WORK-STUDY OPPORTUNITIES

**Structure:**
- Student provides admin/community support
- 5-10 hours per week
- In exchange: 30-50% tuition reduction
- Specific role (community manager, tech support, etc.)

**Benefits:**
- Student invests time (skin in game)
- You get support in running program
- Win-win value exchange
- Maintains respect for program value

**Roles:**
- Community manager (answering questions, welcoming new members)
- Tech support (helping with platform, recordings)
- Social media support (creating content)
- Event coordination (setting up calls, reminders)

---

#### 4. PAYMENT PLANS (Make Full Price Accessible)

**Don't Discount - Make Monthly:**
- Instead of lowering price, offer extended payment plans
- Full price maintained
- More accessible through monthly payments
- Requires commitment contract

**Examples:**
- $4,000 program = $850/month x 5 months (slight increase for plan)
- $6,000 program = $1,200/month x 5 months
- $9,000 program = $2,000/month x 5 months

---

---

### PRICING PSYCHOLOGY

**Anchoring:**
- Present highest tier first
- Makes mid-tier feel reasonable
- People anchor to first number seen

**The Power of 9:**
- $2,997 feels less than $3,000
- $497/month feels less than $500/month
- Use this strategically

**Odd Numbers Feel More Specific:**
- $3,247 feels more considered than $3,000
- Implies precision and value calculation
- Can increase perceived value

**Round Numbers for Premium:**
- $10,000 feels more premium than $9,997
- For high-ticket, round is powerful
- Suggests confidence in value

---

### TESTING PRICING

**Start Higher Than You Think:**
- Easier to lower than raise
- Test market's willingness to pay
- Can always offer discounts
- Hard to raise prices on existing audience

**A/B Test If Possible:**
- Offer two price points to different segments
- See which converts better
- Consider lifetime value, not just conversion rate
- Higher price might convert less but be more profitable

**Survey Your Audience:**
- Ask: "What would you expect to pay for this?"
- "What would be too expensive?"
- "What would be so cheap you'd doubt quality?"
- Find the sweet spot

**Increase Gradually:**
- Raise prices 15-25% each year
- Or: with each cohort
- Grandfather existing students
- Communicate value increases

---
