## üéØ THE FOUNDATIONAL TRUTH

> **"The inside is the reflection of the outside."**
> **"That which we carry inside will be reflected outside back at us."**

### What This Means:
‚ú® Your outer reality mirrors your inner state
‚ú® External situations reveal internal patterns
‚ú® Healing within transforms your external world
‚ú® You are the creator of your experience

**With this statement alone, most of the work can be done, understood, and transcended.**

**Whenever in doubt, in confusion, or in despair, return to this ONE TRUTH.**

## üõ§Ô∏è THE TWO PATHS

You have two choices in healing:

### PATH 1: THE UNCONSCIOUS WAY
üåä Allow life to create situations that explode in your face until you learn
üåä React to crises as they arise
üåä Learn the "hard" way
üåä Be dragged toward healing

### PATH 2: THE CONSCIOUS WAY
‚ú® Actively explore your psyche
‚ú® Seek out places that need healing
‚ú® Do the work before crisis forces you
‚ú® Walk willingly toward liberation

**You are choosing Path 2 by doing this work.**

## ‚öñÔ∏è THE ULTIMATE TRUTH

> **"You cannot avoid your healing; you can only delay it."**

Eventually, you will learn the lessons you came here to learn.

**The question is:**
Will you do the minimum to pass the game, or will you give it your best effort since this is your only ride?

## üíî UNDERSTANDING TRAUMA

### Everything Is Trauma

**"All is trauma. You've got to tattoo that one."**

Trauma exists on a spectrum:
- Big trauma ‚Üê‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Üí Small trauma
- Obvious wounds ‚Üê‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Üí Subtle patterns
- Remembered events ‚Üê‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Üí Pre-verbal imprints

**Any time trauma was experienced, there was a division within you.**

Anywhere you didn't understand and didn't make peace with it = trauma.

### The Fragmented Self

**Aspects are NOT metaphors. They are REAL.**

- Parts of you frozen in time
- Mini versions of you with their own thoughts/feelings
- Still reliving the original trauma RIGHT NOW
- Waiting to be integrated back into wholeness

**We all have PTSD in some form, in some hidden place in our psyche.**

## üîë THE HEALING KEYS

### KEY #1: RADICAL HONESTY
**"Radical honesty will set you free."**

- Stop lying to yourself
- Meet ALL parts of yourself
- Don't look away from what you find
- Accept what is

**You can't afford letting one minute more not knowing why you do what you do.**

### KEY #2: FEELING IS THE SOLUTION
**"FEELING is the solution to everything."**

- Not thinking ABOUT emotions
- Actually FEELING them to completion
- Staying present with intensity
- Allowing full release

**Beliefs are held together by FEELINGS, not thoughts.**

### KEY #3: GO TO THE BOTTOM
**"When you think you've reached the bottom, go deeper."**

- Don't stop too soon
- The mind will trick you into thinking you're done
- Keep going until natural release
- Trust the process

**The bottom isn't where you think it is.**

### KEY #4: BODY WISDOM
**"The body holds what the mind cannot process."**

- Your body existed longer than your consciousness
- Every cell contains information
- Physical sensations are guidance
- Listen to what your body knows

**The body has its own intelligence.**

## üåä UNDERSTANDING THE WAVES

### After a good day ‚Üí expect a bad one
### After a bad day ‚Üí expect a good one
### Before a breakthrough ‚Üí expect a challenge
### After a breakthrough ‚Üí expect integration/stagnation

**THIS IS NORMAL. MAKE PEACE WITH IT.**

The less you resist the changing tides, the more balanced the waters become.

## üî• THE HARD TRUTHS

### You Can't Heal with the Bullet Still Inside

Putting the arm back together will cause pain.
Removing the bullet from the wound will cause pain.

**You have to go through it‚Äîthere's no way around it.**

It won't always be painful. With practice, it becomes easier, even ecstatic.

### Creating New Patterns Hurts

Creating a new neural pathway means going AGAINST the ones you already have - which may be detrimental, toxic, and illogical to the heart.

**This is why resistance comes up. This is why it's difficult. This is normal.**

### Your Mind Will Resist

Thoughts like:
- "It's too much"
- "It doesn't work"
- "It's retraumatizing me"
- "I'm too tired"

**These are the workings of the mind, the ego. It will try anything to make you stop.**

**The mind's job is to keep you safe = repeating the same learned patterns.**

**You know dissociation is not the solution moving forward.**
